Please share your story here with us!
1,Nguyen Hai An,,Psychology,None,None,None,,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"What I remember and cherish the most about Fulbright is that it’s where I got lost and found myself. For almost three years, I didn’t really know what I was doing here. I came in wanting to study psychology to help people. But the psychology classes I took didn’t give me the feeling that I was actually learning how to do that. I studied a lot, learned a ton across different subjects - but still felt lost. People would come to me with their problems, and even with everything I knew, I couldn’t really help them.

Then I joined the Person-Centered Counseling class, and it completely changed everything. There, I learned how to talk to people, how to reflect their emotions, how to affirm their strengths, and how to provide information and inspire hope. After that, everything just started to make sense. I finally had a channel - a way to put what I’d learned into practice. I felt reborn and motivated. In some way, the class inspired me just like how it taught me to inspire people, and I think that’s - very cool.","When I started at Fulbright, I was just kind of... lost. I came in straight from high school, where I didn’t try very hard. I didn’t think I was smart. I didn’t think I was anything, really. Most of my time was spent gaming, staying inside, avoiding stuff. I was passive, quiet, and honestly didn’t know how to handle life. I wasn’t miserable, but I wasn’t doing great either.

At Fulbright, everything hit me fast. The workload, the expectations, the people who actually knew what they were doing. I had no clue how to keep up. Classes were tough. Juggling readings, chores, gym, food - it was a lot. I got overwhelmed. A lot. But I kept pushing through, even when I felt like I was drowning.

There wasn’t a single “aha” moment for me - it was more like a slow, messy climb. Every semester I learned a little more, failed a little less. I started showing up to class prepared. I joined conversations. I asked questions. Sometimes I even had answers. I started seeing myself differently—not as someone who’s just trying to keep up, but as someone who actually belongs here.

And somewhere in the middle of all this, I stopped hiding. I started making friends. Talking to people. Being present. Not perfectly, not all at once - but enough to notice the difference. I even started helping others with their own stuff, using what I’d learned. That part still surprises me sometimes.

I’m still figuring things out. I still want to be a counselor, and now that dream feels a little more real. I have a long way to go, but at least now I’m walking in the right direction.

To my parents - thank you. I don’t say it enough, but I love you. Everything I’ve done here, I owe to your support and belief in me. I’m going to try my best to make you proud.

Fulbright wasn’t just a place I studied - it was the place I grew up. Slowly. Awkwardly. But honestly. And that’s what I’ll remember most."

I’m so grateful for my friends, advisors, and communities who embraced the real me and helped me find my true passions with a smile!",N/A
3,Do Thu An,,Economics,None,Applied Mathematics,None,,"If you didn’t see me much, that means I was doing it right.",The learning journey with the friends I have made along the path.,"My journey at Fulbright has truly been a remarkable one, filled with growth, exploration, unexpectations, and deep learning. When I first started here, I was a bit unsure of what to expect. But over time, the environment at Fulbright has nurtured me in ways I never imagined. From the supportive faculty to the incredible peers, I have not only acquired knowledge but also learned to embrace challenges, think critically, and push my own limits.

Fulbright has changed me in ways that go beyond just academic achievements. It has taught me to value collaboration, open-mindedness, and resilience. I have come to appreciate not only the value of learning but also the process of unlearning and evolving.

Looking ahead, I aim to continue building on the solid foundation I’ve gained at Fulbright. I aspire to contribute meaningfully to my field and work towards creating positive change, whether in business, society, or in the lives of others. My experience here has solidified my desire to be a part of something greater than myself, and I am excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.

A huge thank you to all the professors, staff, and friends who have been part of this incredible journey. Your encouragement and support have been invaluable, and I am forever grateful for the experiences and memories we’ve shared. And to my fellow students, let’s keep pushing boundaries, chasing our dreams, and supporting each other along the way."

My university life was filled with joy, energy, and connection, especially at The Waterfront, where everything felt new yet strangely familiar. I often unconsciously have deja vu of the time I caught COVID, not for the illness, but for the way my peers showed up with care and kindness. In that moment, I realized what it meant to belong, to be seen and cherished. Fulbright gave me more than an education—it gave me a community, a rare and beautiful one, that I may spend years searching for again.","I still remember the moment I realized just how much I wanted to become a part of the Fulbright family, I kept circling around the question, “Why Fulbright?” It echoed in my mind until I finally started taking the idea seriously. I looked back at my journey—the things I’d done, the moments that shaped me, the passions I had for baking and hospitality. And the more I reflected, the more certain I became: I didn’t just want to go to Fulbright—I needed to. Fulbright woke something up in me from the very beginning. For the first time, I felt that my individuality, my story, and even the “unconventional” parts of me were not only accepted but celebrated. Where others once said baking or extracurriculars were a waste of time, Fulbright said they mattered. Fulbright said I mattered.

After four years, what I hold most dearly from my time here is the gift of self-agency and reflection. Fulbright taught me how to pause, look inward, and face the uncertainty of the world around me. I’ve learned that it’s okay not to have all the answers, that growth often begins in discomfort. I won't say I’ve stopped avoiding hard truths altogether—but I have learned to be more open, to meet challenges with a realistic yet kinder view of myself. I’ve learned how to listen—not just to others, but to what’s happening inside me.
Looking ahead, I want to keep creating—with my hands, my words, and my choices. I want to build a life where authenticity, care, and curiosity guide me. I want to keep showing up, even when things are messy, even when I’m unsure.

To every beautiful soul I’ve met at Fulbright—thank you. You’ve shaped my journey in ways words can hardly capture and reminded me, time and time again, why choosing Fulbright was the best decision I’ve ever made.

To my very first house, 133A—you were my shelter, my laughter, my late-night talks, my home. To CIDO club, where I found not just a place to belong, but a place to lead, to learn, and to grow. To đại đội 6, thank you for being my steady ground and for supporting me so wholeheartedly during those early days when I was still learning what it meant to lead. To all my professors who gave so generously of their time, patience, and wisdom—thank you for seeing me, for believing in me, even when I was still learning how to believe in myself.

And above all, to cô Nga, thầy Matthew, and thầy Tony—my deepest love and gratitude. You didn’t just teach me; you transformed me. Your kindness, brilliance, and belief in me anchored me through my most uncertain moments. Because of you, I walk forward not just with knowledge, but with purpose, courage, and heart.

Head of Human Resources - Fulbright Debate Club - AY23-24","No more exams, just life quizzes. Cheers to adulting! ","If I had to choose one memory to hold onto forever from Fulbright, it would be Universe Dance Competition 2023 with The Luminous. We weren’t just a dance team - we were a chaotic, loving, resilient little family. We practiced like crazy for three months. Late nights, sore bodies, missed meals, endless run-throughs. There were moments we cried, shouted at each other, felt like quitting. But somehow, we always came back - because we believed in what we were building.

Exactly 14 of us, and our team “mommy” anh Nguyen, stood on that stage, hearts pounding, hands shaking, but eyes locked on the same dream. It was my last UDC, our second time representing Fulbright, and we gave it everything. Every time I rewatch the video or see a behind-the-scenes moment, I tear up. Not because it was perfect, but because we made it through, together. That experience taught me how beautiful it is to work hard for something you love, with people you love, even when it’s tough. From that journey, I learned what it really means to be resilient, sympathetic, and goal-oriented. And most of all, I learned how powerful it is to not give up on each other.

","From panic to peace (rollercoaster - this is the same theme as my Essay applied to Fulbright)

I still remember when I was that girl with a clear path: study biology, get into med school, save lives. Period. But then boom - a plot twist. Somehow, I ended up here, at Fulbright. The first few months in Saigon were intense. I had a major culture and mentality shock. Fulbright was exciting but terrifying at the same time. I was still this chaotic girl who wanted to do everything all at once, with no clear priorities. I got all at once (debate, dance, investment, social enterprise, etc.), which was a truly a chaotic starting point. It was messy. I was overwhelmed. 

But slowly, it got better - because of people. Lan Thanh, Thuy An, Phuong Linh, Tu Linh… thank you for being the calm in my storm. You reminded me that I wasn’t alone. You were there through the breakdowns, the breakthroughs, the all-nighters, and the silly laughs. I’m so lucky to have found you all. I should reward them as my beloved anchor, my late-night ramen buddies, my reality checks, and my hype squad.

Things truly began to shift in my third and final year. That was when Computer Science entered the picture. A huge shoutout to thầy Đăng - he’s the reason I found a passion for data and tech. I used to doubt him when he said things like, “Cái này chắc chắn có trong vòng phỏng vấn BA, DA, v, đó các em,” but he was so right. Those exact questions popped up in my real interviews. So to my juniors from Co26, Co27, Co28... just trust thầy Đăng, okay?

And then there’s cô My. I wish I had met her earlier. She’s been like a big sister to me, both in terms of knowledge and emotional support. She’s been like a big sis, a mentor, and my favorite “partner in crime.” From casual conversation to deep life talks, she gave me both brain boosts and emotional support. Love you so much!

This final year was also the first time in two years that I didn’t take on an internship. I dedicated all my time to studying, and it changed everything. My mental health improved, and I felt more connected to the university community than ever before. Big hugs to everyone who screamed my name when I got into the final round of Ứng viên tài năng, and to those who believed in me even when I doubted myself during the job hunt.

So here it is - my last word. Of course I had moments I hated. The panic. The stress. The nights I cried over broken code and broken dreams. But if you ask me if I’d do it all again… yes. No regrets. Fulbright wasn’t just a university. It was a turning point in my life. And I’m proud of the person I’ve become here."

First off, huge thanks to all of my professors who have put up with me and supported my growth throughout this journey. I want to give special thanks to Thầy Graeme Walker, my professor and capstone advisor. You’ve been the kindest and most thoughtful professor I’ve ever had the privilege to work with and learn from.

A massive shout-out to all my fellow Fulbrighters and classmates, you guys have been wonderful.

","The most cherished thing at Fulbright is the deadlines. Anyone whose mind often floats off will understand this. Deadlines keep me grounded by reminding me what I have to do, giving me a consistent sense of belonging so that I can somehow nail my mind in one place. Basically, they’re like those Taobao Bluetooth devices screaming: “CONNECTED SUCCESSFULLY🔌✅”","I think I somehow followed the motto for Co2025: embracing the uncertainty. At first, I was an Art and Media student, until my 2d3d drawing professor gave me a C- for my final drawing (I drew myself). It was worse than my science grade. So, I tried auditing some science classes, not to prove that I was good at it, but to prove that even if my art grade were bad, it would still be better than my science grade. Then, I took some E2 classes to fulfil the requirement, and there, I have found my passion: History. Thankfully, I’m now close to graduating with it. I don’t know how to end this, so let’s just shout out for all History students and professors!!!

If there’s a quiz, best believe there’s an A.","Being surrounded by such a diverse community at Fulbright reminded me that there’s no single way to see the world. Different backgrounds, different stories — every conversation pushed me to think beyond my own lens. I was also taught how to sit with uncertainty, to not have all the answers, and to be okay with that. Looking back, it’s the people who made this journey so meaningful and I found a version of myself I didn’t know existed.","When I first came to Fulbright, I never imagined how much this place would change me, not just academically, but personally. I started off with one major, one minor, and a lot of uncertainty. Like many others, I thought I had it all mapped out. But Fulbright has a way of surprising you, of gently pushing you toward paths you never thought you'd take. 

One of the most memorable moments of my journey here was the day I decided to add one more minor, one I never expected. It wasn’t part of the plan. I wouldn’t have had the courage to make that choice without the people who surrounded me. To my professors, thank you for seeing potential in me, even when I couldn’t see it myself. Your belief in me, your constant encouragement, and your willingness to listen helped me step far outside of my comfort zone. To the friends who stood by me, thank you for always having my back. Whether it was cheering me on, staying up late to talk things through, or simply reminding me that I’m capable — you were there. 

Looking back, choosing that unexpected minor wasn’t just about checking another academic box. It reminded me that I’m allowed to change direction, to be curious, and to trust myself even when the path isn’t clear. These people helped me expand not just my academic horizons, but the way I see the world and myself. They encouraged me to try new things, embrace risks, and be okay with not always having a plan. Whether it was saying yes to a new opportunity, speaking up in class when I used to stay quiet, or learning to appreciate uncertainty, I owe that to them."

But, to choose one, I would choose the day I wanted to come back to the most: to be that naive first year talking about grand topics far past midnight at Circle K. It’s a moment I will never forget, for what we talked about and for the smell. About the topics that were totally much bigger than all of us in that conversation, but also the trademark smell of instant noodles at the store. That moment, among countless I have had during my four years at Fulbright, embodies more than just normal chit chat conversations. It is the meaning of this university, and the meaning of going to a university in general. It is the conversation of those, for the past four years, sheltered away to think, to read, and to discuss with such liberty. Of course, it might not be the only time in our life that such conversations were possible, but I believe it would never be the same conversation when we were in our 20s. 

Moments like these. It made us who we are. Perhaps, we might only live these moments for once. The conversations in our young 20s were never perfect, because they never needed to be. It was random and messy. It was out of nowhere. And it was in Circle K. At midnight. For no reasons. Perhaps, it’s all we need for memorable 20s.","I will remember every moment of the past four years at Fulbright. All of them. Nonetheless, Fulbright has turned me into someone who has a strong conviction with everything I believe and everything I do. It is a great disbelief of mine that a story could be told in separation, or could be independently written. Four years was a long time, but it was a story rather than a journey, so it must be told with respect to others, which is yet to happen.  I would live up to my belief for now, and wait for another day to tell the story of my time at Fulbright. For the record and for the Yearbook, yes, it was memorable.

","One of my most cherished memories at Fulbright was performing on stage in the Dance and Performance class taught by Prof.Alexander Tu Nguyen. Together with my team “Go Grrrrr,” we poured our hearts into a hip-hop performance that I’ll never forget. At first, I danced like ""một con lăng quăng"" - awkward and unsure. But after days of practicing and pushing myself, I finally found my rhythm and confidence. Standing on stage in front of hundreds of people, I wasn’t just remembering the moves - I was living every beat, every step, and channeling all my energy into the dance. That moment of self-expression, growth, and pure joy will always stay with me. It reminded me of how far I’ve come and how much I can do when I try my best.
Thank you to all my teachers, especially Cô Ái Phạm, for your support and dedication. You helped me shine.","When I first stepped into Fulbright, I had no idea how deeply it would shape me. I was just another freshman - quietly observing, unsure of how I’d fit in. Now, looking back, I see a journey filled with growth, inspiration, and moments I’ll carry with me forever.

My Fulbright story began in an unusual way - online, during my first semester amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Everything was new: teaching methods, professors, and even friends I could count on one hand. I was overwhelmed, constantly wondering if I could keep up. But gradually, I learned to unmute myself, to speak up, and to reach out for help. That lonely start taught me resilience and made me appreciate in-person connection even more deeply when it finally arrived.

One of the first milestones that changed me was Fulbright Leadership Camp 2023. It was more than a camp - it was a space for self-discovery. I met people who dreamed boldly, cared deeply, and inspired me to do the same. We danced, debated, and connected in ways that reminded me of the power of community.

Later, I returned to a class I once loved - Digital Marketing with Professor Willem - this time as a Teaching Assistant. I helped organize the Hackathon, worked closely with students and businesses, and saw how learning can bridge into real-world impact. Thank you, Prof. Willem, for believing in me. That experience solidified my passion for education, mentorship, and creating empowering spaces.

At the same time, I served as Team Coordinator for FulbrightX, one of the most creative teams I’ve worked with. FulbrightX isn’t just a program- it’s a mindset. We reimagined how students express ideas, built events from scratch, and supported one another through every challenge. FulbrightX taught me to lead with compassion and to turn vision into action - even with limited resources.

To my professors: thank you for your patience and passion. To the Fulbright staff: thank you for your quiet support and kindness behind the scenes. To my friends: thank you for late nights, heart-to-hearts, spontaneous coffee runs, and the laughter that made Fulbright feel like home.

As I prepare to leave, I don’t feel sadness - just deep gratitude. Fulbright gave me confidence, courage, and a community. I now know I want to work at the intersection of business and social change, uplifting youth and creating opportunity.

To those just starting: take the leap, even if your voice shakes. Fulbright is more than a school - it’s a space for transformation. I’m endlessly grateful to have called it mine.

Here’s to the firsts, the failures, the friendships, and the future. Thank you, Fulbright.

Best case, you don’t have to pick again.","When I look back on my time at Fulbright, it’s the people that I cherish the most. The friendships, the community, and the culture here have shaped me into who I am today. At Fulbright, I’ve always felt like I could truly be myself. Whenever I was overwhelmed by work or stressed about the future, conversations with Fulbright friends never failed to bring me comfort and clarity.
From late-night calls in the first semester with my CIDO friends to 2AM coffee chats, these moments made this journey unforgettable. More than just classmates, these are the people who’ve walked with me through change, growth, and self-discovery.","I entered Fulbright thinking I’d pursue Economics or Psychology, but I’ll be leaving with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. That shift didn’t just happen—it was made possible because Fulbright gave me the space to explore, to question, and, most importantly, to choose for myself.
Coming here was the first time I truly stood up to my parents and others to follow what I wanted, not what was expected of me. Through Fulbright, I’ve learned to listen to myself more and trust in my own decisions.
Along the way, I’ve met so many amazing people who’ve helped shape me:
To CIDO’s Co25—Minh Hieu, Thuy Tien, Thuy An, and Phuc Thanh: You were my first friends at Fulbright. I’ll always remember our long late-night calls during the first semester—4AM talks filled with laughter and deep sharing.


To the Braille Music Team—Vu An, Do Trang, Hanh Nguyen, and Tuan: We’ve built something meaningful together, and I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished.


To chị Chi: You’ve been like a big sister to me. I’ll never forget our meals, gym sessions, and your constant care and thoughtfulness.


To Ngoc Linh: We've survived so many courses side by side. Your stories, your intelligence—they’ve always inspired me.
To Le Giang and Phuong Nghi: Thank you for being the kind of friends I could share birthdays, midnight coffee, and countless memories with.
To Tam Phu: Thank you for always looking out for me. You’re incredibly smart and have such a kind heart—I know you’ll be just fine, wherever life takes you.
To 115B, you guys are amazing! Never forget the Hadilao  after every semester.


To thầy Đăng: Your courses are the reason I fell in love with Computer Science.
To thầy Trung: Thank you for your kindness, support, and guidance throughout my time here.
I would always be grateful to all of you. And would always be proud to be a Fulbrighter, no matter what happens."

In moments when you question your competence, remember: during 4 years at Fulbright, you amazed the world. You’ve made the impossible possible. ","I used to think military courses were boring—an absolute nightmare. But the girls in my team completely changed that. They were so supportive and hilarious that I genuinely felt like the main character in a slice-of-life anime—full of yapping, sneaky snacks, and unexpected little moments every single day. Thank you for turning what I thought would be a nightmare into one of the most memorable parts of my journey.

Much love to: Lan Thanh, Dieu Trang, Trang Khuc, Catto, Hoa Linh, and Thao.","Life used to feel like a storm I couldn’t escape. High school left me with too many wounds—being bullied, being afraid to perform even in what I was best at, and being laughed at for dreaming of a place where people value each other for who they are, not just grades. I thought that kind of environment only existed in fiction. My world was too small to believe otherwise.

Then Fulbright happened.

To some, it’s just a university. But for me, it was the miracle that opened a door to the life I never dared to imagine. I wasn’t the best student, but I became something more—I found pieces of myself I never knew were there. I realized I’m more than a number or a GPA. I’m someone with value, voice, and worth.

At Fulbright, I found people who reminded me that kindness and hope still exist. I found a place where I had the right to grow, to explore, and to become. Most importantly, I learned that I deserve that. I’m capable of creating such spaces for others too. That’s why I poured my heart into DAM, a project to help students break free from the bystander effect in bullying—something I once wished I had.

In four years, I lived many lives: an art student, a marketing lover, a neuroscience nerd, and a baby product manager. I realized I could be many things, as long as I followed what I truly love. And somewhere in between… I met your dad? (Yes, future kid. If it didn’t turn out that way… well, just skip this part) A hot nerd who plays guitar and appreciates art—am I in a shoujo anime?! He doesn’t always get my full Scorpio rage, but he stays—and that’s what matters.

I’ve also been lucky to meet the most incredible teachers. Cô Nga, thank you for always standing by my PhD dream. Cô Dung, for believing in my neuroscience journey, even when I dove in headfirst. Thầy Linh, Ethan, thầy Sơn, Ian, thầy Minh, thầy Quân, Matthew, Gareth, cô Lan—thank you for your patience and grace when I tried to solve problems in my own clumsy way. You all taught me that failure isn’t shameful—it’s a bridge.

Shoutout to my amazing research teammates—Nhi and chị Hảo, thank you for growing with me and helping our dream of publishing come true. And anh Rùa, thank you for saving me in my capstone. I couldn’t have made it without you.

To my girls—Minh Ngọc, Viên Nhi, Thảo Chi, Diệu Trang, Thục Anh—thank you for the love, laughs, and fierce support. I hope we all gather again—maybe at my wedding?

Ugh, I don’t want to grow up and grow away from Fulbright. It feels like waking up from the most beautiful dream… and facing a harsher world again. But Fulbright’s magic stays in me. Because of these years, I leave with a dream job, a scholarship to explore the U.S., and a heart ready to grow with the world. Fulbright turned what was supposed to be just a college experience into the most unforgettable chapter of my life."

28,Le Thu Giang,,Computer Science,None,None,None,,"""You are enough, just as you are""","Each time I overcame my own fears to step into different majors, despite the challenges, the process of experiencing and breaking out of my comfort zone is what I remember the most during my four years here. The strong and close relationships between professors and students also made the classes more approachable, allowing for deeper questions and discussions without any barriers. The connections with people here are very warm, and they have taught me many things.","I arrived at Fulbright with the expectation of experiencing an educational system in Vietnam that was free from the constraints of gender biases and societal prejudices—a place where I could learn not merely to apply knowledge but to explore its deeper foundations out of genuine curiosity. Fulbright has changed me a lot, in terms of direction and personality. Thanks to the years of feeling lost and the time spent exploring many fields, I now know that I need to overcome the invisible fears and that I am fully capable of pursuing what I am passionate about.
Living in the dorms for two years, surrounded by my peers, taught me the true meaning of warmth and care through actions. The hardships that hit me and my family felt like they pushed me to my limits, yet I would not have been able to heal, grow, and continue forward without the support of my friends and roommates here.
Dear Fulbright, I sincerely hope that all children in Vietnam, even those who can not afford studying abroad, will one day experience an educational environment like this—one that nurtures intellectual curiosity, personal growth, and unwavering support for each other."

However, at the time I write this message, my commencement ceremony has not yet taken place. But even so, I am sure that this will still be my most memorable moment at Fulbright since it marks my university graduation, celebrates my accomplishments, and encourages me to look toward the bright future. ","Honestly, I don't like Fulbright, I just love people who I met in Fulbright, who changed my life and my mind, and my great journey in here... Until now, I still can't imagine what my life would be like if I hadn't decided to study at Fulbright 4 years ago. About my memorable journey in here, it is marked by a combination of many aspects of my life in the past 4 years, and I believe it will continue even after my time as a Fulbright student comes to an end."
30,Le Thi Hong Ha,,Applied Mathematics,Computer Science,None,None,,Everyday is a new beginning... but can we not begin at 8AM?,"If I had to choose one thing I cherish the most at Fulbright, it would be the small circle of best friends I found in our senior year.

There was something special about those late-night talks over craft beer, the passionate debates, or even the quiet moments where we did nothing at all. With them, I felt like I could truly be myself. We didn’t just listen to each other, we understood. We grew together, driven by shared values and a similar mindset.

They were my anchor when everything else started moving too fast, the deadlines, the decisions, the looming “real world.”

When I think of Fulbright, I don’t just picture classrooms or campus life. I see us, gathered around a laptop, each focused on our own work but still deeply connected. That group didn’t just make my final year memorable, they made it unforgettable.","I could write extensively about both the highs and the lows of my experience at Fulbright, but to sum it up:

There were many moments when I questioned my decision to choose Fulbright, yet here I am, standing strong, still growing, and more grateful than ever for everything this journey has given me.

Fulbright provided me with more than just knowledge. It introduced me to incredible people, professors who were patient and generous with their time, friends who challenged me, listened to me, and walked beside me through all-nighters, deadlines, and life crises. Without them, I wouldn’t be standing at the threshold of what's next. Last but not least, a huge cherish and gratitude to my ""bestie"" for the last four year and many more. 

As I prepare to embark on a PhD journey, a new chapter filled with its own set of challenges, I feel confident. Thanks to everything Fulbright has instilled in me - curiosity, resilience, and a deep love for learning - I am ready for whatever comes next."

I’ve worked many jobs, explored new cities, tried research, picked up new sports (but only stuck with two), tested lots of traditional medicine teas, and tasted new food and drinks. I’ve cooked more (and better!), made amazing friends, and even gone to counseling just to talk through the chaos.

I’ve had accidents, rejections, and low scores — but also scholarships, salary, growth, happiness, and love.

______Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass (Brooklyn, NY: 1855), “Song of Myself,” sec. 52.","It’s hard to choose from the hundreds of memories Fulbright has given me. But when I look back, one of the first things that comes to mind is when I was quarantined during my first months after moving to The Waterfront. It was an unforgettable experience—my roommates and I had to lean on each other as we got through the exhausting days of the pandemic, moving from the dorm to the quarantine hotel. We were all sick, running fevers and feeling drained, but we still shared medicine, cooked simple meals together, played card games to distract ourselves, and video-called friends in other rooms to lift each other’s spirits. Strangely enough, it was still a fun and meaningful time. Without it, we might not have grown so close. All that sharing and caring, especially when we were at our worst, gave me a sense of family in my very first year of college.","Every minute I spent here became a cherished memory, as I was surrounded each day by friends who made me feel like my existence mattered. I'm deeply grateful to the Fine Art group for always being there at the end of each semester and to K11.07 for being my family.

(Interstellar, 2014)","Number of times I ask: ""Why?"" and ""How?"" without feeling the insecurities of not knowing anything. I can come to this point primarily because my IS faculty and peers never judged me for what I said; rather, we had the most healthy and dynamic discussions about any topic just to understand something. But when my thầy cô asked me ""Why?"", I would still be scared to death when I didn't know why =)) Sometimes I replied to thầy Thiết with the most stupid answers, and he'd just give up and explain one single thing for 2 hours. Or when cô Dung asked me ""How?"", I would just freeze, and my cardiac pacemaker would stop working for 2 seconds before I came up with the weirdest hypothesis ever. And she would definitely think and consider this idea for 5 seconds before giving me the right answer.","At the heart of this journey, I believe that the person I am right now is shaped by so many fragments of my dearest friends and teachers and undeniably my family. My sciency version, genuine curiosity for life, and even life choice have been greatly inspired by the Integrated Sciences faculty, to whom I am forever in debt: cô Dung, cô Trang lớn, cô Trang bé, thầy Jesse, thầy Thiết, thầy Vân, cô Sam, and thầy Hùng. Because of them, I have been a learner and a thinker who will definitely spill the most useless facts about human physiology (like why you pee so much after an alcoholic drink) amidst a party. Without these people's support, I would not have the courage and determination to raise the standard for myself and pursue higher learning.
As I embrace the more humane part of me, my peers - my dear friends, colleagues, and mentors (anh/chị/bạn) have always been by my side. Thank you all for the random lab rants, Yakimono therapy sessions, late-night phone calls, and midnight support during sleepovers. You've taught me the most brainrot things ever while managing to be my strongest supporters for me and my intellectual journey.
To my parents – thank you for supporting me in every aspect of life, especially for each of my major decisions in life, even when you didn’t fully understand where they might take me. (Yes, I know you still call my major “Biotechnology” – and that’s okay).
When I look back, I realize this journey never truly started until I enrolled in the course ""Algae"" in my first year's summer semester. Visiting faculty thầy Thiết and thầy Vân not only taught me about algae but also changed my perspective on how the world we're living in works. I started to see the beauty in everything rather than meaning in everything as I imagined the complicated molecular machineries happening beyond my bare eyes. A fallen leaf, my mother's tears when I came out, and me being happy when I listen to Taylor Swift. Sometimes I wonder what if I hadn't decided to drop the course 2D/3D to enroll in Algae. Would I be adrift? Would I be masking my cluelessness with humor and convincing myself that life has a meaning and I had not yet found it (I blame late puberty)?
But while meaning is just an illusion we created to fool ourselves that our life is important, I found these 4 years of mine meaningful. In this long journey, I don't learn from ""Fulbright""; I learn from people who happen to be present in my life, and somehow, some of them happen to be at Fulbright. And if there's only one thing I learnt from Scientific Inquiry, it would be the difference between causation and correlation.
As this chapter closes and I am still at the beginning of my life, I recall what thầy Thiết once shared: ""Who you are is defined by the values you're willing to struggle for."" And I am definitely willing to struggle just to understand a glimpse of this weird world we are living in."

I cherish how people here embrace individuality and the sharing of knowledge, how they openly accept you without judgment (well, maybe just a little at first). I have never felt so comfortable and safe expressing myself. I’ve never felt so secure in voicing my confusion about a topic, knowing that the professors would be incredibly supportive — never judging, always passionate about researching, and genuinely encouraging me to explore and learn on my own.

That’s what I cherish most about Fulbright: a truly collaborative environment where people value knowledge and engage deeply in theoretical or abstract discussions, always eager to share their remarkable, creative ideas.

I'M NOT DUMB. I JUST HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET.","I stayed up all night multiple times as a kid, hoping to see a meteor shower after hearing the news on Thời sự. I never saw one. So as I grew up, I stopped believing I'd ever have the chance to witness it. But here we are—1 AM at Half Moon Lake—watching meteors streak across the sky. It was so unexpected, yet so remarkable. A moment I’ll remember forever.

Fulbright is just like the meteor rain: something I never expected. I never thought I’d move to Ho Chi Minh City, let alone study at a five-year-old institution with its fair share of growing pains and dramas. But here I am—June 7, 2025—graduating with an Economics degree, probably crying in public, missing every fragment of memory, wishing I could go back.

It was chaotic, but it gave me peace of mind. It taught me to be present.

Mình lựa chọn CIDO vào những ngày chưa được học tại trường vì dịch Covid. Vỏn vẹn gần 10 con người đồng hành cùng nhau suốt mùa dịch, làm các dự án online, bonding online, meeting 1-1 để được catch up, rủ nhau đi thi,... để rồi suốt 4 năm đại học, qua nhiều nhiệm kỳ, mình có CIDO như một gia đình, và những người bạn thân nhất ở Fulbright cũng đến từ CIDO. 

Giờ đây CIDO đã có được những sự nhận diện, hiện diện và biết đến nhất định vì những giá trị CIDO tạo ra và một văn hoá CIDO rất chân thành, đầy thương mến. Tụi mình có Club of the year, President of the year, Event of the year,... trong nhiều năm liền, đó là thành quả nỗ lực và sự thương mến từ rất nhiều người trong cộng đồng Fulbright nói chung và CIDO nói riêng.

Nhưng hơn hểt, CIDO cho mình những giá trị con người mà mình sẽ không bao giờ quên được. Suốt thời gian dịch, chị Thu An và các chị Minh, chị Chi, chị Phụng vẫn tâm huyết làm một chuỗi training với nhiều trainer để tụi mình được học rất nhiều topic khác nhau. Cũng nhờ vậy mà tụi mình có những bài học đầu tiên, cũng như cùng với chị Thu An, mình làm đậm hơn career path passion của mình, dù giờ chỉ không theo nghề :""> 

Và CIDO cũng cho mình những người, những chuyến đi, những hành trình đáng nhớ: Thuỷ Tiên, Thuỳ An, Phúc Thành, Thuỳ Dương, Quỳnh Mai, Phương Uyên,... rất nhiều người khác nhưng không liệt kê hết, nhưng Hiếu sẽ mãi nhớ mọi người ở trong tim. ","Hành trình của mình tại Fulbright gói gọn trong 3 điều : Là mình - Là người - Là điều mình cống hiến. 

""Là mình"" ở đây ý chỉ mình tập trung lắng nghe để hiểu bản thân, tìm ra điều mình thích, là mình với phiên bản chân thành nhất trong cảm xúc, đam mê,... vì ở Fulbright là một môi trường đa dạng, ai cũng có những đam mê sở thích riêng, những sự ưu tú và nổi bật riêng, và cả những thành tựu riêng. Làm sao để giữa 1 cộng đồng như vậy, mình vẫn bình tĩnh với những giá trị của bản thân? Vẫn có quyền chọn lối đi riêng, vẫn được nhìn thế giới đầy hài hoà nhưng học trân trọng hơn những người bạn thật sự khiến mình thuộc về và vẫn bình tĩnh sống với điều mình chọn. Ở những ngày cuối đại học, mình có những bước đi sớm trong sự nghiệp cá nhân, và cả làm điều mình chưa từng nghĩ đó là làm capstone, nó cho mình được cảm nhận là mình rõ hơn bao giờ hết.

""Là người"" là chọn được cộng đồng mình thuộc về, dành toàn phần tâm sức để thấu hiểu, để đồng cảm để chia sẻ, để thấu hiểu. Đôi khi giữa 1 công đồng đa dạng, lắng nghe và thấu hiểu cho mình cơ hội để kết nối nhiều hơn. Nhớ hồi dịch tụi mình chơi Haloween với nhau, rồi vào năm học thì đi nhặt rác ở Kiên Giang, Vũng Tàu, đi làm thiện nguyện ở Đắk Lắk hoặc rong ruổi các con phố Sài Gòn để làm cơm từ thiện. Mình được cùng những người khác, học về con người, về thiện nguyện, nhìn con người ở nhiều góc độ, và từ đó kêu gọi được nhiều người cùng đồng hành hơn, và hơn nữa những môn học ở Fulbright không chỉ dạy về kỹ thuật, kỹ năng, đó còn là hành trình quay lại những điều cơ bản nhất của con người, về văn hoá, về hành vi, về mong cầu,... 

""Là điều mình cống hiến"". Mang CIDO trở thành Club of the Year, duy trì các thế hệ đều đặn và đông dần lên qua nhiều năm là điều đầu tiên mình luôn tự hào. Được làm nhiều công việc có ích cho xã hội là thứ hai. Luôn say hi, luôn mong cầu giúp đỡ, chia sẻ với những người bạn của mình là thứ ba. Đấy là những điều cống hiến đã tạo nên mình của hôm nay. Dẫu cho có nhiều mục tiêu về sự nghiệp khác nhưng những điều đó của bản thân tại Fulbright đã cho mình nhiều cảm hứng sống, để từng ngày đều là từng ngày ý nghĩa. "

That warmth and togetherness stayed with me long after the fire went out.","I came to Fulbright not knowing where I was headed — just a kid with a backpack full of questions and a heart half-curious, half-terrified.

From late-night deadlines to that one military campfire night where we all sang like we had nothing to lose — every moment made me feel alive and part of something bigger than myself. Thank you to every face I’ve met along the way. You were the reason there was always a way.

My first WSP, working as an IT Assistant, was especially transformative. I still remember the first time I met the IT staff, I nervously asked: “Will it be extremely embarrassing if someone asks a technical question and you don’t know the answer?” One of them simply said, “It’s normal.” That moment gave me the confidence to show up in class platforms, to fix things when I could, and to ask for help when I couldn’t.

That role opened the door to meeting so many faculty and staff members, forming relationships that turned into unforgettable memories—trips together, grabbing cá viên chiên in District 3, even staying in touch after they resigned. It also led me to become an AA Assistant, where I explored the behind-the-scenes world of university administration. It felt like a sandbox for my younger self, who once imagined growing up to be an ""office worker.""","The journey only truly began when we moved to offline learning in Spring 2022 and moved to the Waterfront. Living in shared dorms taught me how to embrace diversity, resolve conflicts, and accept that being different is not just okay—it’s valuable. I came into Fulbright as an 18-year-old still unsure of myself. But through my peers, I met the real me, and learn to embrace my unique values.

It was these amazing roommates who encouraged me to run for Student Council President in the AY23–24. I never imagined myself leading a team—I’d never done it before—but they believed in me. And their belief gave me the courage to believe in myself.

And then, there’s Running Club. A place where it doesn’t matter if I run slowly—or walk most of the time. The energy, the laughter, the encouragement from both friends and coaches made every run (and every walk) feel meaningful. Without them, the past few years could have felt dark and directionless. I always finished 21km right at the cut off time, yet they never make fun of me when I said I want to finish 42km before I graduate. I never thought I could become one who finds joy in running, but now, I am. And the motto we hold for running applies to every other achievement in life: take small steps, consistently.

It’s not about what I’ve achieved—but about the belief I now carry within me. Fulbright has given me the faith that, whatever comes my way, I’ll be ready to face it—and I’ll nail it."

I have changed a lot since then. I have walked through (haven't I?) the dark several times. My future is uncertain, in a world of fluctuations, wars, economic recession, genocides, political changes, technological breakthroughs (or setbacks). I have some plans for the future, but I'm fearful as fuck. Still, if there's something I would take with me in my Fulbright days, it would be worth-telling, life-changing, thought-provoking stories. I've learned to empathize with others, share their pains and glories, and be kind through stories. I've learned important lessons to carry on in my upcoming journey. This has been a (not) perfect journey, but I appreciate everything has happened."

Regardless of which flow, some of these people stay and teach me more about myself than I can. Chị Trâm and thầy Ian are the few who witnessed my academic progression at Fulbright, to put up a fair share of critique while encouraging me towards a bigger sea. Their academic lessons very much transmute into my personal life, an anchorage for me to keep swimming forward. Meanwhile, Nhi Phan, Tuấn Kiệt, Diệu Trang, Tony, Đắc Hoàng disentangle me as a thinker. I learn to slow down my reasoning, and to listen while appreciating that one's experience of life is just as riveting as academic curiosity. And lastly, Linh Trang teaches me to be a better human, however good I am at rationalizing. Some things are meant to be felt and embodied. Never in the last four years have these flows been such visceral and never in my life have I learned so much.","I still remember vividly my essay application to Fulbright 4 years ago, which discussed Jimin's anatomy of dance in confluence with Carl Jung's theory. Knowing nothing back then, not even myself and my future, I latched onto BTS and their spiritual animal - a purple whale. It was not until 2 years of struggling later in the Psychology department did everything come together. One of my friends 'forced' me into Chị Trâm's ethnography class, which then prompted me further to examine the metaphysics of dance, the rigorous and experimental side of which I could not imagine to have done it. Such an intellectual endeavour continued robustly under chị Trâm's mentorship, only to cultimate in my Capstone thesis in Social Studies, on studying the Holy Whale worshipped in Quy Nhơn. During this time, I also co-founded the Social Studies Symposium, which unexpectedly takes the theme of purple. Through 4 years, that lonely whale, in BTS's 'Whalien 52' song is no longer an alien. He has found resonance across different voices and personalities at Fulbright. He now can come to sing with many others, a note of no beginning or end. "

More than anything, Fulbright has been about the people. Together, we survived 8 AM class, bonded over collective sufferings, attended events for free foods, questioned entire existence over an exam question, and somehow, against all odds, made it through.

And because of people, I have been greatly humbled, pushed, pulled, lost, found, questioned, shaped, cooked, deep-fried, boiled, grilled, (more than occasionally) marinated in uncertainty, stretched thin, rolled out, and folded back together. I have also been seasoned—by conversations steal my sleep, by people who challenged me to think beyond the obvious, by detours that were never part of the plan but turned out to be necessary. Fulbright has been an elaborate, unpredictable buffet—each experience adding its own peculiar flavor, some refined, some utterly chaotic, but all essential to the dish. And in the end, despite the questionable recipes and occasional overcooking, it all came together—unexpected yet perfectly SERVED!!

Not only from Academics but also from Career Development, knowing what I loved and what I wanted to be. ","To Bao Khang of 2021,

This is your future self writing to you, looking back on your college journey with awe and pride. You’d be amazed at how far you’ve come.

Do you remember when you first applied to Fulbright? One of the essay topics you chose was about Fear - fear of not being good enough, of doubting yourself. And yet, four years later, look at what you’ve achieved. You were once someone who rarely took the initiative, especially when it came to teamwork, one of your biggest challenges.

Back then, stepping out of my comfort zone seemed impossible. You hesitated to seek out opportunities. But now, looking back, you've built a path filled with growth and quiet victories. Who would’ve thought you'd end up leading a tennis community on campus, encouraging others to chase a green ball for hours with a racket? Or that you’d keep pushing forward, applying for jobs despite failures and uncertainties?

You’ve come a long way—from a hesitant high school student to a more grounded, emotionally mature young adult. Not only your thoughts but your perspective have changed through the experiences that you have encountered. Now, with just 34 days left at Fulbright, your time here is coming to a close. Graduation is just around the corner, and with it, a new chapter begins. There will be no more classes or campus life, but in its place comes the challenge yet excitement of standing on your own two feet. It’s intimidating, yes, but also full of possibility. 

Thank you, Fulbright, for being such an amazing part of my life. For giving me a place to meet incredible friends, mentors, and professors who have shaped me in ways I will always carry with me. This will forever remain one of the most meaningful chapters of my life.

I’ll see you soon, Khang. It’s time to move forward. Keep your head high, and just keep swimming. 

With love and pride,

I never imagined that there would be days when I would chat with my professors, have lunch with them, ask them how they are doing, or tell them about the things I do in my daily life.

Among the educators here, I would like to give special mention to Dr. Pamela Corey Nguyen and Dr. Luong Ngoc Tram. For me, these are the two professors who shaped my academic direction, helped me find my values, and entered research paths I never thought of: Art History, Visual Culture, Photography, and Ethnographic Practice. I am grateful to Dr. Corey for her dedication, for the thoughtful feedback and advice she gave me in many of her classes at Fulbright as well as for my Capstone Project. I am grateful to Dr. Tram Luong (I often call her Ms. Tram) for nurturing my love and knowledge of photography, connecting my knowledge and practice of photography with further academic interests and always pushing me to become more critical and intentional in everything I do. I also love and appreciate the remaining teachers of AMS and Social Studies, Literature for always living so close to us, allowing us to experience a cozy academic environment.

It’s not just about being surrounded by kind people — it’s about how we hold space for each other’s contradictions, complexities, and questions. There’s a culture here where differences aren’t just tolerated but embraced. Whether in a late-night dorm conversation, a community circle, or a heated classroom debate, I always felt like I belonged — not in spite of my individuality, but because of it.

Fulbright gave me not only the freedom to learn in my own way but the courage to unlearn, to be wrong, and to keep showing up. That, to me, is humans of Fulbright: real stories, real people, real growth.","When I first stepped into Fulbright, I wasn’t looking for answers — I was looking for permission to explore. And Fulbright gave me just that.

It didn’t mold me into a fixed shape. It gave me space to unfold.

The authentic learning culture encouraged me to try, fail, rethink, and design my own learning process. Professors didn’t just lecture — they listened. Classmates didn’t compete — they collaborated. I didn’t just study, I grew.

The diversity of thought here was not decorative, it was foundational. From anthropology to applied mathematics, from philosophy circles to activism workshops, I found myself navigating different ways of thinking and being. It reshaped how I approached knowledge — not as a trophy to claim, but a lens to question the world.

The collaborative spirit at Fulbright meant everything. No matter where you turned — the Library, Student Life, the classroom, even the Crescent Lake  — you’d find someone who’d walk beside you, share a laugh, or gently challenge your ideas.

Above all, it was the community of empathy that transformed me. Not just being heard, but being truly seen. Whether it was in a office hour, a community check-in, or a quiet look exchanged in a tough moment — I realized what a rare thing it is to feel both free and supported at once.

I will leave Fulbright not with a fixed identity, but a toolkit: to listen deeply, to collaborate across difference, to fail gracefully, to think with heart. I carry forward a belief in education as transformation, not transaction.

To those who are just beginning: don’t try to fit in. Be curious. Be weird. Be kind. Your journey will not look like anyone else’s — and that’s the point.

Thank you, Fulbright — for not shaping me, but for letting me shape myself."

I am really proud to be an important part of Fulbright Soccer club.",To my parents and friends: your support meant everything,"To be honest, this part feels more like writing in a diary — finally, no grading criteria after four years.

So, what do I cherish the most?
When I sat down to write this, the first thing that came to mind was my friends and family. They’ve been such a big part of not just my time at university, but my whole life.

I’m deeply thankful for the amazing community I found here at Fulbright. It’s the people — the ones who laughed with me, stressed with me, and grew with me — that made this journey unforgettable.

To all my friends, I’m wishing you nothing but happiness and success in whatever comes next. You’ve made this experience truly special.","It’s been such a great journey here. I still remember the time I submitted my Fulbright application — it was Spring cycle, 23:59, literally one minute before the deadline. Then came the interview round, and somehow, I made it. I became a Fulbright student.

My first semester was completely online. I made a few friends through online discussions and group projects, which felt weird at first, but somehow worked. When I found out we’d be moving to the dorms the next year, I was nervous but also excited to actually meet people in real life. And dorm life turned out to be amazing. I met so many great friends, especially my two roommates — Kyle and Khang Bi. I spent most of that first year at the Waterfront residence with them.

In our second year, we started making new friends from Docklands, and by the third year, six of us — Kyle, Phu, Khang, Tommy, and Luan — moved out together to River Panorama. That apartment became home. We made so many memories there.

I want to thank every single friend I’ve made — you’ve all given me some of the best, most unforgettable memories. And especially Kyle — I once said that all the money, time, and effort I spent here would be worth it just to meet him and become close friends. That still sums it up perfectly.

Also, huge thanks to my family — thank you for always being there and supporting me through everything.

And yeah, that’s pretty much it. I’ll leave the rest of this space for my favorite photos. For me, pictures don’t need to be 4K or anything fancy — as long as the people in them are happy, that’s all that really matters."

Ở Fulbright, mình đã gặp được những người bạn tuyệt vời, cùng đi qua những ngày rực rỡ đến những khi mù sương.

Mình và CIDO đã từng rong ruổi khắp các đường phố Sài Gòn trong những chuyến Community Sharing, cho đến những tỉnh thành lân cận như Tà Lài - Đồng Nai, Vũng Tàu, đến các tỉnh miền Tây như Long An, Kiên Giang và đặc biệt hơn cả chính là chuyến đi xa nhất đến Đăk Lăk – quê của mình. Mình đã vô cùng tự hào khi lần đầu tiên có thể dẫn một nhóm bạn ở Đại học về quê của mình, ăn những món ăn ngon, trải nghiệm những thứ đặc trưng ở quê và làm một dự án cộng đồng ý nghĩa cùng Câu lạc bộ ở trường cấp 3 mình. Còn nhớ năm đó CIDO tụi mình không có quá nhiều tiền để thuê khách sạn ở, 17 đứa ngủ chấp nhận ở tại nhà của mình – căn nhà tự nhiên có tận 17 đứa con, cái phòng ngủ nhỏ xí tự nhiên cũng nhét được tận 7 đứa, rồi thì phòng khách, phòng ăn trở nên nhộn nhịp hơn bao giờ hết.

","Hành trình của mình với Fulbright sẽ luôn là câu chuyện được kể đi kể lại với những người bạn, người em, người đồng đội đồng hành của mình trong suốt cuộc đời khi nói về khoảng thời gian học đại học. Mình biết đến Fulbright nhờ cái duyên khi có cơ hội được nói chuyện với chị Hiền (Co24) khi 2 đứa đang là học sinh cấp 3. Mình biết yêu Fulbright khi nghe về câu chuyện thành lập, triết lý giáo dục và sứ mệnh đóng góp cho giáo dục Việt Nam, thấy giá trị mà bản thân mong muốn rất match với trường, mình dồn hết sức để apply vào và chinh phục trường bằng mọi giá. Rồi mình cũng từng tạm dừng và thậm chí muốn dừng luôn hành trình này khi gặp quá nhiều thử thách trong học tập, trong các mối quan hệ bạn bè, sự mông lung, vô định giữa dịch Covid trầm trọng ngay năm đầu tiên đến với Fulbright. Nhưng rồi sau tất cả, mình quyết định cho bản thân một cơ hội nữa để thử lại, mở rộng lòng hơn để đón nhận những trải nghiệm và thử thách “uncertainty” mà mình gặp phải, Co25 gặp phải và ngay cả trường cũng luôn phải đối mặt.

Nhân đây, mình cũng xin gửi lời cảm ơn sâu sắc đến tất cả những người bạn, người anh chị, thầy cô và các staff của trường đã đồng hành và hỗ trợ mình rất nhiều từ những ngày biết đến trường, apply, đậu, học, gap year, đến khi quay lại, bắt đầu lại rồi tốt nghiệp.

Yet, I am always grateful, for each path teaches me something new.","Building a robot was my first real Engineering project—it was where everything started for me. And honestly? It was brutal. The hardest course I had ever taken. I still remember those nights, the ones without sleep. Debugging an entire system, every layer of the stack, without any real experiment to guide me. Just code, logic, and endless frustration. Tired? Absolutely. Wanted to give up? More times than I can count. But somehow, somewhere deep inside, the passion kept burning. It wasn’t just me anymore—it was my teammates, their encouragement, their late-night problem solving, their belief in me when I doubted myself the most. That energy? That’s what got me through.And when I look back now, I can still feel it—the exhaustion, the relief, the sheer disbelief that I actually survived it. But I did. And that course? It didn’t just teach me robotics. It taught me grit.","The journey I went through wasn’t just about learning engineering—it was about discovering what it truly means to be an engineer. At first, I was focused on the technical side—pure classes like Electronics, Robots… and I felt stuck in that. It was all about circuits, code, and mechanics.But as time passed, I started seeing the bigger picture. Engineering isn’t just about assembling things, it’s about managing work, understanding people, and recognizing their needs. The technical skills? They’re just tools. What really matters is the attitude—the mindset, the willingness to learn, adapt, and lead.I became more open, more aware of the human side of engineering. And when I look back now, I realize that DST—the class I barely paid much attention to in the beginning—turned out to be the most impactful one.

It wasn’t easy. We had to be creative with the limited resources we had. But seeing everyone come together despite the exhaustion and stress of training—working in secret to make the surprise happen, even filming a video in our little resting time—made it unforgettable.

To this day, our group has celebrated many birthdays together, but this one still stands out as the most special.

The idea of rigorous academics, challenging courses, and unfamiliar environments was both intimidating and exciting. But what I didn’t expect was the incredible community and the friendships that would define my experience here.

Fulbright has given me the courage to apply for my first internship in my first year, which opened up so many opportunities I never imagined I would have. Balancing a full-time job with full coursework was not a pink dream — it was nights of sleeplessness, burnout, and self-doubt. But every time I fell, my friends were there for me. They didn’t just cheer me up with their words; they helped me catch up with school, proving that everything would be fine. This experience truly reflected the spirit of Fulbright: pushing boundaries while supporting one another through it all. And I am forever grateful to have met all of you.

Fulbright has changed me in ways I never anticipated. It taught me not only how to solve complex problems but also how to approach challenges with resilience and creativity. I learned that learning isn't just about the answers — it’s about the journey, the failures, the breakdowns, and the breakthroughs along the way. Through every lecture, group project, and late-night coding session, I’ve discovered more about my own limits, strengths, and passions.

As I move forward, I aim to continue embracing challenges head-on and applying what I’ve learned here — both academically and personally. The experiences, the friendships, and the lessons will continue to shape who I become.

A huge thank you to my professors, especially thầy Hiếu and thầy Linh, who pushed me to stretch my limits while still placing trust in me. To my friends, who stuck by me in the toughest times and celebrated with me in the best.

Fulbright was the place where I met strangers who turned into teammates, friends, and sometimes heartbreaks. Some drifted in and out, some stuck around for a while, and a few stayed for good. But every single one left something with me — a lesson, a laugh, a late-night talk, a moment I didn’t know I’d hold onto.

Group projects were... something else. From smooth-sailing dream teams to chaotic messes that left me editing slides at 2AM — I weirdly loved it all. Even the worst projects ended with a shared meal and conversations that made me feel seen. That’s the magic of Fulbright: even when things go wrong, people show up.

I think most about those unexpected friendships — the ones that started with a random chat, a shared playlist, or just a feeling that we got each other. We were all so different, but somehow, it worked. Some of those friendships ended quietly, some painfully. But I’m thankful for every one of them.

And to the ones still here with me now — thank you. You’ve been my cheerleaders, my crisis hotline, my people. You made Fulbright more than just a university. You made it mine.

I’ll carry all of you with me. Always.","It’s been a wild, beautiful, and unforgettable ride.

I didn’t have some grand plan when I applied to Fulbright. It was a spontaneous decision — my high school friends mentioned it, I googled it out of curiosity. “Liberal Arts”? “US-Vietnam relations”? I had no clue what those even meant. But as I scrolled through Fulbright’s website, something clicked. I pictured myself there. I clicked “Apply.”

That one impulsive moment brought me to a place that changed everything.

I entered Fulbright as a wide-eyed freshman, unsure of my English, emailing Learning Support just to ask for a slot in the Bridge Program. I wasn’t from a “gifted school,” hadn’t experienced international-style education — I felt lost, intimidated, and like I didn’t belong. I messaged strangers with “@fulbright.edu.vn” in their bios just to feel less alone.

Then, life started to happen. First friends, first classes, first late-night talks that spiraled into something more. I was overwhelmed — by the culture, the constant push for reflection, the discussions, the intellectual rush. I tried to keep up, but somewhere in the chaos, I lost a bit of myself.

It took time — and a lot of mistakes — to learn that I didn’t have to change who I was to thrive here. Sophomore year taught me how to slow down, to be patient with the process, to say “no” when something didn’t align with my values. I started choosing what mattered, not just what was impressive.

But Fulbright wasn’t all heavy. Some of my best memories live in Fulbright Event Hub, Fulbright Tennis, and The Luminous. I found joy in organizing, in leading, in building something with friends. The laughs, the stress, the breakthroughs, the tears — all of it stitched together something so real. Those moments will stay with me forever.

And somewhere along the way, Kyle. We started as classmates, then friends, and now — partners in every sense. We’ve studied, led the Tennis Club, rewritten our resumes a hundred times together. We’ve celebrated wins, survived losses, and stood by each other through it all. I’ll always be grateful to Fulbright for bringing us together.

Now, at the end of this four-year journey, I see someone different in the mirror. Someone who takes ownership of his life, who’s willing to take risks, fall down, and get back up again. Someone who dares to dream a little bigger.

I came in not knowing what Fulbright really was. Now, I leave knowing that Fulbright is a part of me. And I’ll always be proud to say: I’m a Fulbrighter."

They were there when the skies dimmed, lifting me up with words of comfort and silent strength. Because of them, these final chapters of university feel not only lighter, but also richer — filled with laughter, meaning, and warmth.","For me to study at Fulbright, my parents made a significant sacrifice. That understanding has stayed with me from the very beginning, so when I moved to Saigon, I made a promise to myself: I would become financially independent as soon as possible to lessen the burden. From the first year, I threw myself into work. I worked relentlessly and achieved my goals. 

However, by the end of my third year, something hit me: I had lost what people often call ""the college experience."" I had no study group. No road trips with friends. No late-night heart-to-hearts. I hadn’t spent time with professors to truly explore ideas, or with classmates to build deep connections. I had missed out on the things that make college unforgettable. 

So I decided to open my heart—to people, to experiences. I paused the race up the corporate ladder and shifted my focus back to school. For the first time, I traveled to the beach with my friends. I pulled an all-nighter with a study group, cramming for an exam as the sun came up. I danced, played sports, stayed out late, laughed until I cried. For the first time, I felt like a real college student. 

I’m truly grateful for the people who walked into my life during this time. Friends who listened, who stayed, who supported me through every storm and celebrated every small joy. Professors who reminded me why I love to learn. And my parents, whose quiet sacrifices continue to be the foundation of everything I do."

I love how nearly everyone I met in this university is so open to hear from each other despite our different paths. The university's history so far has gone through major changes and shakeups, but this friendly spirit remained constant which was reassuring. This will be what I miss the most once I'm gone from FUV.","Saying that it was memorable is an understatement. I never inteneded to make friends at the start of university at all, and for 2.5 years... that was what happened: Moving through schoolwork while ignoring potential connections. Bascially, I was passing through like I never existed.

Things changed as I noticed how easy it was to connect with people in here. 

The turning point was when I attended Introduction to Video & Film Production in Spring 2023. I began to feel confident about sharing my ideas with other people, and so the last few years were extremely fun as I up the ante in many of my film and creative projects, trying to surpise/discomfort them as much as I can. Before I knew it, I had more friends than I could ever imagine.

Maybe I could have done this all along, but the more important lesson here is that I only need to focus on the future and its potential and don't let ""what ifs"" and regrets of the past slow you down as FUV's friendliness allows you to progress at your own pace. As long as I've gained something, the past was nothing.

That was truly a special experience—it allowed me to genuinely feel the cross-cohort spirit and understand what Fulbright is really about.

“Being lost costs,” they say,
Either follow the road or stay,
Yet, I stray, 
Charting my own ways.

(Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien)",One word: Fulbrighters.,"“Voiceless” was the title of my entrance essay to Fulbright. It talked about the unheard stories of villains in fairy tales and how I empathize with them for being a misfit right in my own home. Bad versus evil, Ian must be glad that his teaching about “slave morality” touched me deeply. I started as a tempered high school kid trying to get myself out of the home where I felt misunderstood. Now, I find myself back in that same place, transforming both the love and pain into arts that I hold dear. I no longer want to purge the bad memories or cover them up with new ones. “Ethnographic gold,” chị Trâm would say, reminding me of how I can see through these bad memories and faded pain to learn more about my lineage. 

Now, I consider myself an intellectual nomad and an art practitioner who pays close attention to established institutions to pose questions about agency, identity, and phenomenology. Blending ethnographic works and art making, I see myself as a channeller, through which social forces materialize as visual patterns, sound waves, and words. In Bodies That Become Spatial (2024), a series of 30 low-exposure photographs, me and Hoang (my roommate) turned the Exit hall, a site where identities are suspended, into a workshop of meaning-making, spinning webs of light that stands in for the morphology of identities. In The Playgrounds (2025), a two-minute stereo audio mix, I cast myself in a self-made urban horror movie, grappling with the compressing adulthood in an exploitative neoliberal cityscape. Recently, with a new interest in making gastronomic reviews, I examined the aesthetics and taste of food reviewers including myself. Getting to know Michelin’s entangled history of being both a global gastronomic curator and a rubber baron with various plantations in Indochina, I wrote a preliminary research paper to explore how Michelin employs aesthetics and mystification to dissociate from its colonial history in Indochina, reframing its identity through the particular language of global culinary excellence.

Actress (Má Liên) - Fulbright Theater - AY24-25","Half chaos, half cupcake... fully committed to the vibe","What I cherish most about Fulbright is the freedom to reinvent myself. It’s a place where there are no set paths, allowing me to explore new interests and redefine who I am. At Fulbright, I can be a scholar, an artist, or an activist without the pressure of fitting into one box. The freedom to fail has been key to this reinvention. Unlike traditional academic settings, where failure often feels like a setback, here it’s seen as part of the learning process. I’m encouraged to experiment and take risks without the fear of being judged. This has helped me grow academically and personally. Fulbright has allowed me to branch out beyond my original field of study, blending multiple disciplines that enrich my thinking. It’s given me the chance to explore different sides of myself—both as a student and as an individual. I’ve learned to embrace vulnerability, something I didn’t do before, and I’ve grown more open-minded and compassionate. Beyond academics, Fulbright has helped me understand my place in Vietnam and my role in the country’s future. It’s a space where I can challenge ideas, reflect on my identity, and contribute to a larger conversation about the world. The autonomy to shape my own education has been empowering. Fulbright doesn’t just offer a rigid curriculum; I’ve been able to pursue what excites me and take ownership of my learning. This flexibility has been crucial in my personal growth. ","I can still remember the first day I stepped onto the Fulbright campus: excited, nervous, and maybe just a little bit overwhelmed. I was stepping into an environment that was totally new to me. But as soon as I walked through the doors, I felt something different. It wasn’t just the beautiful campus or the impressive facilities, it was the energy. The energy of people who were as excited to learn and explore as I was, people who weren’t afraid to challenge ideas and push boundaries.

When I first came to Fulbright, I thought I knew exactly what I wanted. I had my major, my goals, my expectations. But what I didn’t know was that Fulbright would change everything. It’s here that I learned how to reinvent myself. I started with one set of ideas, but I’ve evolved so much since then, academically, personally, and creatively. Fulbright gave me the space to try things I never would have attempted before. To explore new passions, meet people from different walks of life, and dive into fields I never thought would interest me. It pushed me to be a better version of myself, more confident, more open-minded, and more willing to embrace change and uncertainty.

There were moments, of course, when I doubted myself. Moments when I questioned my path or wondered if I was making the right choices. But those moments were part of the process. Fulbright never told me to have all the answers right away. Instead, it encouraged me to explore, to fail, to learn, and to grow at my own pace. And in the end, those doubts became my greatest teachers.

The friendships I’ve formed here have been another highlight. Fulbright is full of people who challenge you, who inspire you, and who help you become the best version of yourself. I’ll never forget the late-night conversations with friends and professors, where we debated everything from politics to art to the meaning of life itself. These moments, these connections, have shaped me in ways I’ll carry with me forever.

As I think about the future, I can’t help but feel excited. I have so many ideas, so many dreams, and I know that Fulbright has given me the tools and confidence to make them a reality. My time here has shown me that my journey is just beginning and that I don’t need to have it all figured out right now. What matters is that I keep moving forward with curiosity, with passion, and with the courage to follow my own path.

A huge thank you to everyone who made this experience unforgettable. To my professors who pushed me to think beyond the obvious, to my friends who made every day an adventure, and to Fulbright for being the kind of place where reinvention is not just allowed but encouraged."

- An interdisciplinary tragedy (2025).","There were moments of stress, uncertainty, academic struggle, and more than a few existential crises - times that pushed me far beyond what I thought I could bear. But strangely, it’s not just the hardship that I’ll remember. It's the quiet kindness, the warmth of unlikely friendships, and the gentle, unexpected ways people showed up for each other. Amid the chaos, there was something soft and human, and that’s what I’ll carry with me the most.","I came to Fulbright with no idea what was going on, like being dropped into the middle of the sea: no map, no compass, overwhelmed by the vastness, and afraid of the waves. Four years later, I still don’t know exactly where I’m headed, but I’ve learned how to swim. I’ve made peace with the waves, and the ocean no longer frightens me. In the end, I realize that life isn't necessarily about reaching the shore, but about learning to move with the waves. That transformation is the journey I’ll remember most from my time at Fulbright.

Thank you to everyone who has shared this journey with me, whether by living, working, or simply bearing with my endless tides of mood and thought. Even on the messiest days, I have learned so much from each of you. To those who have stood by me through chaos and patiently listened to my rants for hours, you deserve the world. Moreover, a special thank you to all my professors, especially Professor Pamela Corey, who have been so kind, dedicated, supportive, and academically inspiring. Without all of you, I may have remained a hopeless, unacademic potato floating in existential soup. You guys have helped me grow more resilient and more equipped to keep moving forward. And for all of that, I will always be grateful!"

Life in a new city had barely begun before everything was put on pause. I didn’t tell my parents—I didn’t want them to worry. Alone in an unfamiliar place, I felt homesick and lonely.

""Luckily"", my roommate caught it too ( ;))) ). So we became quarantine buddies. We attended online classes by day, and in our free time, we’d sing random songs together. I especially remember ""Ngày đầu tiên"" by Đức Phúc—it had just come out around that time. We sang it non-stop until we were out of breath. Even now, whenever I hear it, all the memories of those quarantine days come rushing back (along with the scent of saline spray!).

After we recovered, we returned to our dorm and were welcomed back with a full-on ribbon-cutting ceremony. Turns out, being F0 had its perks."

I didn’t join many clubs, I wasn’t the most outgoing person, and there were moments I felt a bit disconnected. Fulbright taught me that growth doesn’t always look like being in the spotlight.

","The most expensive thing i'm wearing? Probably my brain - built through years of regression, replication, and relentless revisions 
- Kyle ","These All-Nighters Made Me

My college nights split into two chapters.

The first: nights out with my people—at The Waterfront, Docklands, anywhere we could just be. We were young, curious, a little wild. Those nights were filled with laughter, stories, tears, spontaneous drinking in Japanese town, clubbing till we crashed, wandering the residence halls just to feel something real. We shared everything—secrets, silence, sadness, joy. I met strangers who became friends, and friends who became memories. I made choices I celebrated and mistakes I had to sit with. But through it all, I learned. I grew. I’ll never forget those nights.

The second chapter: the study nights. The real, raw ones. The anxious cramming, the silent breakdowns, the Red Bulls and Monsters lined up on my desk like soldiers. The instant noodles at midnight, the endless loop of lo-fi beats. I used to hate exams—still kind of do—but somehow, I survived every one. I mastered the art of the all-nighter. Somewhere along the way, I stopped panicking and started trusting myself.
To everyone who was part of this chaos—my housemates, study buddies, 3AM Zoom crew, my cheat sheets and most importantly, my grades—thank you. You were part of it all.

These nights made me who I am. And no matter how much time passes, I’ll always remember them.","Fulbright was a wild, beautiful ride—and it wasn’t always easy. I made choices that pushed me beyond what I thought I could handle. But if there’s one thing I walk away with, it’s this: I became my own best friend. I learned to love numbers (yes, seriously), and I made myself proud.

This place gave me more than just an education. It gave me people—so many different individuals, each with their own quirks, stories, and strengths. I’m lucky to have kept high-quality connections with teammates, housemates, and faculty who shaped me. From them, I learned humility, collaboration, and how to handle conflict with grace. The Fulbright community supported me every step of the way—and one day, I promise to give that same support back to someone else who’s lost, confused, and curious like I once was.

To the people who held me up—thank you.
119A, my first home.
L307 and River Panorama, where the realest moments happened.
Minh Phu, Loc Le, Khang Bi, and Tommy—my constants. You’ve seen all sides of me: the laughs, the breakdowns, the chaos, the growth. I’m grateful for your love and support, and I’m so excited to watch each of you shine after Fulbright.

Academically? Let’s just say, I used to run from math like it was chasing me. But then I took on Computer Science (shoutout to Tommy for surviving those courses with me—even if we’re in Econ now). Eventually, I found my fit in Economics. Algorithms didn’t work out, but regressions did.

Minh Phu—thank you for being the calm in my academic storms. Your patience, your belief in me, and your endless encouragement helped unlock the best version of myself. That A-streak in advanced Econ? That’s ours. I’m in the final stages of my capstone now, crunching data and theories, and I’ve never felt more confident, sharper, or more ready to take on challenges.

One thing I’ll never regret? Developing the Fulbright Tennis Club. From day one, I poured my energy into it, and even on the tough days, you all reminded me why it mattered.

Chi Diem Quynh—thank you for always seeing my effort.
Minh Phu—your compliments meant more than you know.
Khang Bi & Tommy—thank you for being the hands that held everything together.
Ly & Quan—you’re the future of this club, and I can’t wait to see how you grow it.
Other members—I am truly happy to see you guys get to be better every day

At the end of it all, I have no regrets.

Everything I gave, everything I felt, everything I tried—it made these four years unforgettable.

I am proud of myself for submitting that application four years ago.

I will miss Fulbright and the people here so, so much. 
Thank you for letting me know what it feels like to be loved, supported, and seen.
","At Fulbright, I did not just gain knowledge or a new mindset - I gained the brothers and sisters who became one of my most important support systems. These were the people who saw me at my worst - broken down and crying my eyes out - but still poured strength and confidence into me with their support, love, understanding, and humor. 

It would be a huge miss not to mention the very first online semester here. Even though we were going through so much, I still treasure those sleepless nights we called “study group”—supposedly to study, of course. But it usually turned into yapping, singing, and laughing till 5 am. Thanks to you guys, my first year of university - even while being stuck at home with Covid - was still super great and memorable (dedicated to mhiu, an đào, thùy dương, phúc thành). Please know that I will forever be grateful for all my heroes here!!!

And the people don’t stop at friends - they also include the faculty and staff, who supported me both academically and personally. Thank you, cô Lan (Faculty of Psychology), cô Lan and thầy Ngọc (Faculty of Economics), chú Bình, anh Hậu, anh Tâm, các anh các chị cleaning staff who quietly helped and supported me throughout this journey. 

Finally, I would not be here, writing these words, without my family. 
Thank you, Mom, for being the first person to believe in me more than I believed in myself.

Thank you, Hưng, for silently supporting me through every small act.

Fulbright might not have been where I thought I'd end up, but looking back, I wouldn't have it any other way.","What I cherish most at Fulbright isn’t a building or a moment—it’s the people. It’s the students, the Fulbrighters, that I met in the early days, the reason I chose this school. I didn’t know it then, but I was looking for a connection, for people who would see me, grow with me, and hold me up when I couldn’t stand on my own. And I found them here.

To the ones who stayed, and to those who left along the way: Thank you for the sleepless nights, the shared silence, the deep convos, the uncontrollable laughter, and the tears. Thank you for the lessons you taught me about love, vulnerability, forgiveness, and strength. You made Fulbright home.

Whatever paths we take from here, know that I’m rooting for you. Always. May your journeys be kind, your hearts stay open, and may you never forget how deeply you’ve touched the life of one friend who was lucky enough to walk this road with you.","I walked into Fulbright with more questions than answers, carrying a suitcase half-filled with clothes and half-filled with dreams I hadn't yet dared to say out loud. I was 18, clueless and unprepared, and stumbling through uncertainty. Now I’m 22, still finding my way through uncertainty, but with a clearer sense of who I am and the courage to face what comes next. Fulbright has been more than just a university to me. It’s been a playground for curiosity, a battleground for self-doubt, and a sanctuary for self-discovery. I found mentors who saw potential in me when I couldn’t see it myself. I found friends who challenged me, cried and laughed with me, and cared for me. I learned that learning doesn’t just happen in classrooms—it happens in spontaneous dorm debates, in the hustle of the coffee shop, and in deadline night breakdowns with Monsters and snacks. There were times I wanted to give up. Times I thought I didn’t belong. But Fulbright taught me that growth can be uncomfortable sometimes; every failure, every confusing assignment, every group project that almost ended friendships: all of it shaped who I am today.
To my professors: thank you for pushing me, for your patience, and for seeing more than just a GPA.
To my friends: thank you for the unfiltered laughter and the deep 2 AM talks that reminded me I’m never alone.
To Fulbright: thank you for teaching me that kindness is a strength, and that the future is something we build, not wait for."

If there’s space for one more letter…

I think if I had the chance, I would write something to every single person in this community. To the Class of 2025, to the faculty, to the staff - to those still here and those who’ve already left. Because Fulbright, to me, has never been just about a college or a degree. It’s been about people.

To my fellow Co25 friends, many of whom I’ve had the joy of sharing classes, meals, laughter, stress, and late-night rants with: thank you. I don’t think there’s a single person in this cohort I haven’t crossed paths with in some way. And every time, it felt like something added to the fabric of my journey. Maybe it was a short chat on campus, a group project that nearly broke us, a random deep conversation, or just a familiar face at a time I needed it most. You made this place feel like home, even on the hardest days. I carry so much love and respect for each of you. More than anything, I’m genuinely so excited to see all of you fly high and far. You are all so, so capable, and so talented in ways that continue to amaze me. Watching you grow, and growing alongside you, has been one of the greatest honors of my life. Truly. It’s been a privilege to call so many of you my friends.

To the faculty, whether you're still teaching here or have moved on, thank you for your patience, your passion, and your presence. Some of you changed the way I see the world, not just through lectures or feedback, but through the way you taught us to think critically, to think ethically, and to think empathetically. Even when I didn’t have the answers, you made it feel okay to ask better questions. I’ve felt seen, challenged, and encouraged in ways I didn’t expect when I first walked into those classrooms.

To the staff, past and present, I want you to know how much your work has meant to me and to all of us. The check-ins, the support emails, the behind-the-scenes work you never asked credit for, the way you remembered our names and asked how we were doing, even during the busiest times. It’s hard to put into words how comforting it is to feel genuinely cared for in a space that could’ve easily been just another institution. You gave it heart.

These past four years have not been easy for Fulbright. We’ve all felt the waves, the uncertainties, the growing pains. But I truly believe that each of you, in your own way, in your own capacity, has done your best to steer this ship through so many storms. And for that, you deserve more gratitude than we probably ever say out loud. Thank you for showing up, for holding the line, and for keeping the school afloat even when things were tough.

Especially to the Admissions team (and I say this with deep love and immense gratitude), thank you for letting me be a part of your world for the past four years. I want to be clear that I deeply cherish every department in this school, and I hope the rest of you will forgive me for singling one out. But working with Admissions was something truly special. I’ve learned so much, not just about outreach or selection, but about people, about kindness, about stories, and about the quiet, powerful impact of believing in someone before they even believe in themselves.

There’s no single memory that sums it all up. It’s the little things that linger: the way someone held the elevator door, the messages during Capstone madness, or the quiet comfort of walking into a room full of people who somehow, despite all our differences, understood what this journey meant. Fulbright gave me a thousand tiny memories that, stitched together, made something I’ll hold onto forever.

So if this is the last letter I get to write here, let it be a thank you. A quiet, sincere, full-hearted thank you. I’m leaving, but I’ll always carry this place, and all of you, with me.

With love,"

Also remember: ""Hôm nay lật sách, ngày sau lật tiền""","During my four years at Fulbright, I’ve had both good and bad memories—but I cherish them all, as they’ve shaped who I am today. Among them, the military training course (MTC) stands out as the most beautiful and emotionally truthful experience I’ve had.

There are two main reasons for this. First, MTC reminded me of my high school days. Unlike university life, where everyone is caught up in their own hustle, MTC placed us all in the same routine, same conditions, and same goal—making it out alive. Like high school, we studied, ate, and slept together. In that uniform setting, the only personal things we had were our emotions and relationships. With nothing else to distract us, we had all the time in the world to care for one another.

Second, the intensity of the training pushed us to find joy in the simplest, most organic ways. On the first day, I expected to keep to myself and get through it quietly. But the harsh summer heat and physical challenges brought us closer. We shared fans, food, jokes, drinks—and even moments of lying on the floor half-naked just to cool down. We supported each other through every chore and challenge, without conflict, because we knew we were all in the same boat.

It felt like rediscovering childhood with people my age—playing, singing, and bonding like kids again. It was rare, raw, and something I’ll carry with me for a long time.","My Fulbright journey began in August 2021 with great excitement as I moved into the dorms, imagining something like a Scout camp. But living away from home for the first time brought unexpected loneliness, despite staying in touch with family. Learning to manage daily life independently was a major shift. Social connections didn’t come easily at first, and my academics took time to find their rhythm. However, courses like Prof. Kinho Chan’s and Prof. Jonathan London’s courses had a transformative impact.

Things gradually shifted. Moving to Docklands in my second year brought closer friendships and a more stable environment. I explored Math, Engineering, and eventually found a home in Arts and Media Studies. I’m grateful for foundational film training with Professors Linda, Viet Linh, Phan Dang Di, and Ivan Small. My academic experience deepened in the later years, especially in 300-level courses. Prof. Pamela Corey’s art landscape class and Prof. Tram Luong’s ethnography course were eye-opening. Prof. Tobias’s curiosity-driven approach connected diverse fields in meaningful ways. Even personal hardship, became a space for reflection, thanks to Prof. Ian Kalman.

In my final year, I discovered Vietnam Studies with guidance from Prof. Nam and Prof. Hoang. Fulbright has shaped me into a more resilient, reflective, and curious person.

I am deeply grateful to the professors and friends who inspired and supported me. Your impact will stay with me for life. Thank you."

I came in uncertain, always questioning if I belonged or if I was doing enough. I leave still full of questions, but more at peace with not having all the answers. Somewhere between late-night reflections, quiet breakdowns, unexpected encouragement, and small wins, I started to trust myself more.
It wasn’t always easy, and it definitely wasn’t always graceful—but it was honest. And that’s what makes it unforgettable."

This quote reminds me that every grand journey begins with the courage to take that first small step. For me, this adage has been a silent yet persistent motivator on days when doubt loomed large.","What I cherish most about my time here is the permission I found to explore - the freedom to try things I had never even considered possible before. 

I had always been curious about the arts and the sciences, and Fulbright offered a rich tapestry of courses and extracurricular activities that allowed me to dabble in drawing, singing, dancing, filmmaking, engineering, and research. Each new class or workshop was a doorway to experiment, to fail, and ultimately to learn something profound about myself.

I also cherish the moments of serendipity - those unplanned adventures that turned into some of my most treasured memories. Whether it was an impromptu jam session in the dorm common room, a spontaneous road trip to explore hidden parts of Saigon, or the quiet evenings spent under the stars discussing our dreams and fears, these experiences reminded me that life is full of unexpected wonders.

Ultimately, my time at Fulbright taught me that education is an expansive journey. I learned that intellectual growth is intertwined with personal development and that every activity contributes to a richer, more complex sense of self. The chance to embrace so many different facets of learning has forever altered my outlook on life. Fulbright was not merely a place of study; it was a nurturing ground for curiosity, courage, and creativity. It showed me that the real value of education lies in the diverse experiences that challenge you to become better, kinder, and more resilient.","I come from a mountainous region where access to higher education was a distant dream. This journey at Fulbright, which began in a small, remote village, has transformed me in ways I once only dared to imagine. My time at Fulbright is a tapestry woven with hardship, discovery, and triumph.

In my hometown, resources were scarce, and expectations were modest. Education was valued, but opportunities were limited. The decision to leave my mountainous home and venture to Saigon was both exhilarating and terrifying. Saigon, with its bustling energy and modern allure, was a stark contrast to my quiet, rugged upbringing. I arrived with a mix of excitement and apprehension, unsure if I would fit in or if I was even capable of achieving what many deemed impossible.

Studying at Fulbright was a turning point - a validation that my potential was recognized beyond the boundaries of my humble beginnings. It opened doors not just to academic excellence, but also to a world of experiences that I had never imagined I would encounter. At Fulbright, I was not just a student; I was a creator, a performer, a researcher, and ultimately, a person in the making.

Perhaps the most transformative aspect of my time at Fulbright was the community I found here. My classmates and professors came from diverse backgrounds, each bringing their own unique perspectives to the table. Our differences were not barriers—they were bridges that connected us. In group projects, late-night study sessions, and spontaneous discussions about life and dreams, I discovered the power of collaboration and empathy. I made friends who challenged me to grow, who celebrated my successes, and who held my hand during moments of doubt. The support and understanding I received were beyond what I could have ever hoped for.

I learned to trust my instincts, to stand firm in my decisions, and to embrace the uncertainty of the future with open arms. Every setback was a lesson, every failure a testament to my resilience, and every success a glimpse of the person I was becoming.

The most profound impact of my Fulbright experience is how it reshaped my understanding of purpose. Coming from a normal background, I had always dreamed of a future where I could transcend the limitations imposed by my circumstances. Fulbright not only provided me with the education to pursue that dream—it instilled in me the confidence to believe that I could make a meaningful impact in the world. With my newfound skills and experiences, I was able to secure a job aligned with my passion for music—an area I had always loved but never imagined could be a viable career. This opportunity, born out of chance and nurtured by hard work, has given me the confidence to face every decision with a sense of purpose and determination."

Core Team Member & Player for Life - Fulbright Ultimate Club","At Fulbright, I didn’t just step out of my comfort zone — I leapt. And in that leap, I found resilience, purpose, and the courage to grow.","I still vividly remember my first day at Fulbright — which was also the very first day of my first semester. I had two classes that day and was excited to arrive on time, eager to meet my professors and classmates.
Strangely enough, it was also my first time stepping foot on the Crescent campus. I didn’t know how to enter the buildings or where the classrooms were. I was too embarrassed to ask anyone, thinking to myself, “How can I be a student here and not even know where my classes are?”
I still smile at those early moments — the awkwardness, the embarrassment of my first wrong answer, and even the first time I called a professor by their first name without realizing it. But those moments quickly passed. From the very beginning, I was surrounded by kind friends, peer mentors, and supportive instructors.
I’m deeply grateful to have studied at Fulbright and to have grown in such a heartwarming environment that allowed me to make mistakes, learn from them, and build the courage to step outside of my comfort zone.
President Scott once shared that one of the guiding principles of our university is to create a safe and supportive space where students are encouraged to speak up, take initiative, and continuously grow. Thank you for saying it — and thank you, Fulbright, for truly living it.
Because over these past four years, I’ve felt it deeply: I’ve been embraced, nurtured, and empowered to become the best version of myself.","As you can see on this page, my memories with Fulbright are also deeply tied to my time with the Fulbright Ultimate Club (FUC), our ultimate frisbee team. Over the past four years, I’ve laughed, cried, pushed through pain and bitterness, and received so much love from our coaches and teammates.
My journey with FUC has been far more than just athletic training — it’s been a journey of stepping out of my comfort zone, building resilience, and learning how to love, care for, encourage, and inspire others like a true family.
Through FUC and frisbee, I’ve traveled across Vietnam and even to other countries for tournaments. We’ve shared victories, earned medals, and made memories that I’ll carry for life.
And deep down, I know that all the love and memories we’ve shared could only have happened here — at Fulbright.
Fulbright is a place where inclusiveness, diversity, and equality are truly cherished. It’s where students are lifted up, where we’re given a safe and empowering environment to pursue our dreams — even the wildest ones."

So I always have something to say about ""duyên"" whenever I think about the journey that got me here and the time I journeyed here. It's not just about the academics, but it's also about the people I have had the chance to encounter and know personally. I want to take this space to thank founding Professor Andrew Bellisari who altered my brain chemistry in his Global Humanities class and then his nefarious course Pirates, Prisoners, and Prostitutes: An Outcast History of French Indochina, founding Professor Kevin Hart whom I was in his Foundations of Literary Studies class during his last semester at Fulbright, Professor Yến Vũ who taught me elegance in nourishing my writing and her overwhelming patience with me, Professor Richard Streitmatter-Trần for forever inspiring me with his art practices and the philosophy in making life choices (and fashion choices), Professor Izzy Liendo for whom I was working in her classroom as a teaching assistant and also a student in her crazy courses - for her sweet-toothed treats and never leaving me behind on those difficult burn-out days, Professor Linda Zhang who entrusted me with my first classroom assistant job and made me feel so loved working for, and Professor Jasmine An for giving me the guts and dictionary to craft my thoughts into poetry.
