      <td>What I remember and cherish the most about Fulbright is that it’s where I got lost and found myself. For almost three years, I didn’t really know what I was doing here. I came in wanting to study psychology to help people. But the psychology classes I took didn’t give me the feeling that I was actually learning how to do that. I studied a lot, learned a ton across different subjects - but still felt lost. People would come to me with their problems, and even with everything I knew, I couldn’t really help them.\n\nThen I joined the Person-Centered Counseling class, and it completely changed everything. There, I learned how to talk to people, how to reflect their emotions, how to affirm their strengths, and how to provide information and inspire hope. After that, everything just started to make sense. I finally had a channel - a way to put what I’d learned into practice. I felt reborn and motivated. In some way, the class inspired me just like how it taught me to inspire people, and I think that’s - very cool.</td>
      <td>When I started at Fulbright, I was just kind of... lost. I came in straight from high school, where I didn’t try very hard. I didn’t think I was smart. I didn’t think I was anything, really. Most of my time was spent gaming, staying inside, avoiding stuff. I was passive, quiet, and honestly didn’t know how to handle life. I wasn’t miserable, but I wasn’t doing great either.\n\nAt Fulbright, everything hit me fast. The workload, the expectations, the people who actually knew what they were doing. I had no clue how to keep up. Classes were tough. Juggling readings, chores, gym, food - it was a lot. I got overwhelmed. A lot. But I kept pushing through, even when I felt like I was drowning.\n\nThere wasn’t a single “aha” moment for me - it was more like a slow, messy climb. Every semester I learned a little more, failed a little less. I started showing up to class prepared. I joined conversations. I asked questions. Sometimes I even had answers. I started seeing myself differently—not as someone who’s just trying to keep up, but as someone who actually belongs here.\n\nAnd somewhere in the middle of all this, I stopped hiding. I started making friends. Talking to people. Being present. Not perfectly, not all at once - but enough to notice the difference. I even started helping others with their own stuff, using what I’d learned. That part still surprises me sometimes.\n\nI’m still figuring things out. I still want to be a counselor, and now that dream feels a little more real. I have a long way to go, but at least now I’m walking in the right direction.\n\nTo my parents - thank you. I don’t say it enough, but I love you. Everything I’ve done here, I owe to your support and belief in me. I’m going to try my best to make you proud.\n\nFulbright wasn’t just a place I studied - it was the place I grew up. Slowly. Awkwardly. But honestly. And that’s what I’ll remember most.</td>

But over time, the environment at Fulbright has nurtured me in ways I never imagined. From the supportive faculty to the incredible peers, I have not only acquired knowledge but also learned to embrace challenges, think critically, and push my own limits.\n\nFulbright has changed me in ways that go beyond just academic achievements. It has taught me to value collaboration, open-mindedness, and resilience. I have come to appreciate not only the value of learning but also the process of unlearning and evolving.\n\nLooking ahead, I aim to continue building on the solid foundation I’ve gained at Fulbright. I aspire to contribute meaningfully to my field and work towards creating positive change, whether in business, society, or in the lives of others. My experience here has solidified my desire to be a part of something greater than myself, and I am excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nA huge thank you to all the professors, staff, and friends who have been part of this incredible journey. Your encouragement and support have been invaluable, and I am forever grateful for the experiences and memories we’ve shared. And to my fellow students, let’s keep pushing boundaries, chasing our dreams, and supporting each other along the way.</td>

      <td>Fulbright, to me, is more than just a university—it’s a memory, a feeling, a home that gave me a profound sense of belonging. My university life was filled with joy, energy, and connection, especially at The Waterfront, where everything felt new yet strangely familiar. I often unconsciously have deja vu of the time I caught COVID, not for the illness, but for the way my peers showed up with care and kindness. In that moment, I realized what it meant to belong, to be seen and cherished. Fulbright gave me more than an education—it gave me a community, a rare and beautiful one, that I may spend years searching for again.</td>
      <td>I still remember the moment I realized just how much I wanted to become a part of the Fulbright family, I kept circling around the question, “Why Fulbright?” It echoed in my mind until I finally started taking the idea seriously. I looked back at my journey—the things I’d done, the moments that shaped me, the passions I had for baking and hospitality. And the more I reflected, the more certain I became: I didn’t just want to go to Fulbright—I needed to. Fulbright woke something up in me from the very beginning. For the first time, I felt that my individuality, my story, and even the “unconventional” parts of me were not only accepted but celebrated. Where others once said baking or extracurriculars were a waste of time, Fulbright said they mattered. Fulbright said I mattered.\n\nAfter four years, what I hold most dearly from my time here is the gift of self-agency and reflection. Fulbright taught me how to pause, look inward, and face the uncertainty of the world around me. I’ve learned that it’s okay not to have all the answers, that growth often begins in discomfort. I won't say I’ve stopped avoiding hard truths altogether—but I have learned to be more open, to meet challenges with a realistic yet kinder view of myself. I’ve learned how to listen—not just to others, but to what’s happening inside me.\nLooking ahead, I want to keep creating—with my hands, my words, and my choices. I want to build a life where authenticity, care, and curiosity guide me. I want to keep showing up, even when things are messy, even when I’m unsure.\n\nTo every beautiful soul I’ve met at Fulbright—thank you. You’ve shaped my journey in ways words can hardly capture and reminded me, time and time again, why choosing Fulbright was the best decision I’ve ever made.\n\nTo my very first house, 133A—you were my shelter, my laughter, my late-night talks, my home. To CIDO club, where I found not just a place to belong, but a place to lead, to learn, and to grow. To đại đội 6, thank you for being my steady ground and for supporting me so wholeheartedly during those early days when I was still learning what it meant to lead. To all my professors who gave so generously of their time, patience, and wisdom—thank you for seeing me, for believing in me, even when I was still learning how to believe in myself.\n\nAnd above all, to cô Nga, thầy Matthew, and thầy Tony—my deepest love and gratitude. You didn’t just teach me; you transformed me. Your kindness, brilliance, and belief in me anchored me through my most uncertain moments. Because of you, I walk forward not just with knowledge, but with purpose, courage, and heart.\n</td>

      <td>If I had to choose one memory to hold onto forever from Fulbright, it would be Universe Dance Competition 2023 with The Luminous. We weren’t just a dance team - we were a chaotic, loving, resilient little family. We practiced like crazy for three months. Late nights, sore bodies, missed meals, endless run-throughs. There were moments we cried, shouted at each other, felt like quitting. But somehow, we always came back - because we believed in what we were building.\n\nExactly 14 of us, and our team “mommy” anh Nguyen, stood on that stage, hearts pounding, hands shaking, but eyes locked on the same dream. It was my last UDC, our second time representing Fulbright, and we gave it everything. Every time I rewatch the video or see a behind-the-scenes moment, I tear up. Not because it was perfect, but because we made it through, together. That experience taught me how beautiful it is to work hard for something you love, with people you love, even when it’s tough. From that journey, I learned what it really means to be resilient, sympathetic, and goal-oriented. And most of all, I learned how powerful it is to not give up on each other.\n\n</td>
      <td>From panic to peace (rollercoaster - this is the same theme as my Essay applied to Fulbright)\n\nI still remember when I was that girl with a clear path: study biology, get into med school, save lives. Period. But then boom - a plot twist. Somehow, I ended up here, at Fulbright. The first few months in Saigon were intense. I had a major culture and mentality shock. Fulbright was exciting but terrifying at the same time. I was still this chaotic girl who wanted to do everything all at once, with no clear priorities. I got all at once (debate, dance, investment, social enterprise, etc.), which was a truly a chaotic starting point. It was messy. I was overwhelmed. \n\nBut slowly, it got better - because of people. Lan Thanh, Thuy An, Phuong Linh, Tu Linh… thank you for being the calm in my storm. You reminded me that I wasn’t alone. You were there through the breakdowns, the breakthroughs, the all-nighters, and the silly laughs. I’m so lucky to have found you all. I should reward them as my beloved anchor, my late-night ramen buddies, my reality checks, and my hype squad.\n\nThings truly began to shift in my third and final year. That was when Computer Science entered the picture. A huge shoutout to thầy Đăng - he’s the reason I found a passion for data and tech. I used to doubt him when he said things like, “Cái này chắc chắn có trong vòng phỏng vấn BA, DA, v, đó các em,” but he was so right. Those exact questions popped up in my real interviews. So to my juniors from Co26, Co27, Co28... just trust thầy Đăng, okay?\n\nAnd then there’s cô My. I wish I had met her earlier. She’s been like a big sister to me, both in terms of knowledge and emotional support. She’s been like a big sis, a mentor, and my favorite “partner in crime.” From casual conversation to deep life talks, she gave me both brain boosts and emotional support. Love you so much!\n\nThis final year was also the first time in two years that I didn’t take on an internship. I dedicated all my time to studying, and it changed everything. My mental health improved, and I felt more connected to the university community than ever before. Big hugs to everyone who screamed my name when I got into the final round of Ứng viên tài năng, and to those who believed in me even when I doubted myself during the job hunt.\n\nSo here it is - my last word. Of course I had moments I hated. The panic. The stress. The nights I cried over broken code and broken dreams. But if you ask me if I’d do it all again… yes. No regrets. Fulbright wasn’t just a university. It was a turning point in my life. And I’m proud of the person I’ve become here.</td>

To Cô Liz, Thầy Tobias, and Thầy Minh, thank you for always thinking of us. We students truly don’t deserve you.\n\nA massive shout-out to all my fellow Fulbrighters and classmates, you guys have been wonderful. \n\nTo all my friends who tolerated my panic sessions, endless jokes, and my incurable unseriousness, I love you more than you know, and you’ve helped shape me into who I am today.

So, I tried auditing some science classes, not to prove that I was good at it, but to prove that even if my art grade were bad, it would still be better than my science grade. Then, I took some E2 classes to fulfil the requirement, and there, I have found my passion: History. Thankfully, I’m now close to graduating with it. I don’t know how to end this, so let’s just shout out for all History students and professors!!!\n</td>

But Fulbright has a way of surprising you, of gently pushing you toward paths you never thought you'd take. \n\nOne of the most memorable moments of my journey here was the day I decided to add one more minor, one I never expected. It wasn’t part of the plan. I wouldn’t have had the courage to make that choice without the people who surrounded me. To my professors, thank you for seeing potential in me, even when I couldn’t see it myself.

Whether it was cheering me on, staying up late to talk things through, or simply reminding me that I’m capable — you were there. \n\nLooking back, choosing that unexpected minor wasn’t just about checking another academic box. It reminded me that I’m allowed to change direction, to be curious, and to trust myself even when the path isn’t clear. These people helped me expand not just my academic horizons, but the way I see the world and myself. They encouraged me to try new things, embrace risks, and be okay with not always having a plan. Whether it was saying yes to a new opportunity, speaking up in class when I used to stay quiet, or learning to appreciate uncertainty, I owe that to them.</td>

I cannot say enough how indebted I am to all of them, to my friends, and the Fulbright environment conducive to this rigorous degree of knowledge exchange and production.</td>

      <td>This is the toughest assignment I have been given during my four years at Fulbright. There are plenty, really. But, to choose one, I would choose the day I wanted to come back to the most: to be that naive first year talking about grand topics far past midnight at Circle K. It’s a moment I will never forget, for what we talked about and for the smell. About the topics that were totally much bigger than all of us in that conversation, but also the trademark smell of instant noodles at the store. That moment, among countless I have had during my four years at Fulbright, embodies more than just normal chit chat conversations. It is the meaning of this university, and the meaning of going to a university in general. It is the conversation of those, for the past four years, sheltered away to think, to read, and to discuss with such liberty. Of course, it might not be the only time in our life that such conversations were possible, but I believe it would never be the same conversation when we were in our 20s. \n\nMoments like these. It made us who we are. Perhaps, we might only live these moments for once. The conversations in our young 20s were never perfect, because they never needed to be. It was random and messy. It was out of nowhere. And it was in Circle K. At midnight. For no reasons. Perhaps, it’s all we need for memorable 20s.</td>
      <td>I will remember every moment of the past four years at Fulbright. All of them. Nonetheless, Fulbright has turned me into someone who has a strong conviction with everything I believe and everything I do. It is a great disbelief of mine that a story could be told in separation, or could be independently written. Four years was a long time, but it was a story rather than a journey, so it must be told with respect to others, which is yet to happen.  I would live up to my belief for now, and wait for another day to tell the story of my time at Fulbright. For the record and for the Yearbook, yes, it was memorable. \n</td>

I never imagined I’d meet so many amazing people or create so many unforgettable moments.\n\nFulbright has taken me from being a lazy, self-contained person to someone more energetic and, dare I say, kind of professional.

      <td>One of my most cherished memories at Fulbright was performing on stage in the Dance and Performance class taught by Prof.Alexander Tu Nguyen. Together with my team “Go Grrrrr,” we poured our hearts into a hip-hop performance that I’ll never forget. At first, I danced like "một con lăng quăng" - awkward and unsure. But after days of practicing and pushing myself, I finally found my rhythm and confidence. Standing on stage in front of hundreds of people, I wasn’t just remembering the moves - I was living every beat, every step, and channeling all my energy into the dance. That moment of self-expression, growth, and pure joy will always stay with me. It reminded me of how far I’ve come and how much I can do when I try my best.\nThank you to all my teachers, especially Cô Ái Phạm, for your support and dedication. You helped me shine.</td>
      <td>When I first stepped into Fulbright, I had no idea how deeply it would shape me. I was just another freshman - quietly observing, unsure of how I’d fit in. Now, looking back, I see a journey filled with growth, inspiration, and moments I’ll carry with me forever.\n\nMy Fulbright story began in an unusual way - online, during my first semester amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Everything was new: teaching methods, professors, and even friends I could count on one hand. I was overwhelmed, constantly wondering if I could keep up. But gradually, I learned to unmute myself, to speak up, and to reach out for help. That lonely start taught me resilience and made me appreciate in-person connection even more deeply when it finally arrived.\n\nOne of the first milestones that changed me was Fulbright Leadership Camp 2023. It was more than a camp - it was a space for self-discovery. I met people who dreamed boldly, cared deeply, and inspired me to do the same. We danced, debated, and connected in ways that reminded me of the power of community.\n\nLater, I returned to a class I once loved - Digital Marketing with Professor Willem - this time as a Teaching Assistant. I helped organize the Hackathon, worked closely with students and businesses, and saw how learning can bridge into real-world impact. Thank you, Prof. Willem, for believing in me. That experience solidified my passion for education, mentorship, and creating empowering spaces.\n\nAt the same time, I served as Team Coordinator for FulbrightX, one of the most creative teams I’ve worked with. FulbrightX isn’t just a program- it’s a mindset. We reimagined how students express ideas, built events from scratch, and supported one another through every challenge. FulbrightX taught me to lead with compassion and to turn vision into action - even with limited resources.\n\nTo my professors: thank you for your patience and passion. To the Fulbright staff: thank you for your quiet support and kindness behind the scenes. To my friends: thank you for late nights, heart-to-hearts, spontaneous coffee runs, and the laughter that made Fulbright feel like home.\n\nAs I prepare to leave, I don’t feel sadness - just deep gratitude. Fulbright gave me confidence, courage, and a community. I now know I want to work at the intersection of business and social change, uplifting youth and creating opportunity.\n\nTo those just starting: take the leap, even if your voice shakes. Fulbright is more than a school - it’s a space for transformation. I’m endlessly grateful to have called it mine.\n\nHere’s to the firsts, the failures, the friendships, and the future. Thank you, Fulbright.\n</td>

Through Fulbright, I’ve learned to listen to myself more and trust in my own decisions.\nAlong the way, I’ve met so many amazing people who’ve helped shape me:\nTo CIDO’s Co25—Minh Hieu, Thuy Tien, Thuy An, and Phuc Thanh: You were my first friends at Fulbright.

High school left me with too many wounds—being bullied, being afraid to perform even in what I was best at, and being laughed at for dreaming of a place where people value each other for who they are, not just grades. I thought that kind of environment only existed in fiction. My world was too small to believe otherwise.\n\nThen Fulbright happened.\n\nTo some, it’s just a university. But for me, it was the miracle that opened a door to the life I never dared to imagine. I wasn’t the best student, but I became something more—I found pieces of myself I never knew were there. I realized I’m more than a number or a GPA. I’m someone with value, voice, and worth.\n\nAt Fulbright, I found people who reminded me that kindness and hope still exist. I found a place where I had the right to grow, to explore, and to become. Most importantly, I learned that I deserve that. I’m capable of creating such spaces for others too. That’s why I poured my heart into DAM, a project to help students break free from the bystander effect in bullying—something I once wished I had.\n\nIn four years, I lived many lives: an art student, a marketing lover, a neuroscience nerd, and a baby product manager. I realized I could be many things, as long as I followed what I truly love. And somewhere in between… I met your dad? (Yes, future kid. If it didn’t turn out that way… well, just skip this part) A hot nerd who plays guitar and appreciates art—am I in a shoujo anime?! He doesn’t always get my full Scorpio rage, but he stays—and that’s what matters.\n\nI’ve also been lucky to meet the most incredible teachers. Cô Nga, thank you for always standing by my PhD dream. Cô Dung, for believing in my neuroscience journey, even when I dove in headfirst. Thầy Linh, Ethan, thầy Sơn, Ian, thầy Minh, thầy Quân, Matthew, Gareth, cô Lan—thank you for your patience and grace when I tried to solve problems in my own clumsy way. You all taught me that failure isn’t shameful—it’s a bridge.\n\nShoutout to my amazing research teammates—Nhi and chị Hảo, thank you for growing with me and helping our dream of publishing come true. And anh Rùa, thank you for saving me in my capstone. I couldn’t have made it without you.\n\nTo my girls—Minh Ngọc, Viên Nhi, Thảo Chi, Diệu Trang, Thục Anh—thank you for the love, laughs, and fierce support. I hope we all gather again—maybe at my wedding?\n\nUgh, I don’t want to grow up and grow away from Fulbright. It feels like waking up from the most beautiful dream… and facing a harsher world again. But Fulbright’s magic stays in me. Because of these years, I leave with a dream job, a scholarship to explore the U.S., and a heart ready to grow with the world. Fulbright turned what was supposed to be just a college experience into the most unforgettable chapter of my life.</td>

Thanks to the years of feeling lost and the time spent exploring many fields, I now know that I need to overcome the invisible fears and that I am fully capable of pursuing what I am passionate about.\nLiving in the dorms for two years, surrounded by my peers, taught me the true meaning of warmth and care through actions. The hardships that hit me and my family felt like they pushed me to my limits, yet I would not have been able to heal, grow, and continue forward without the support of my friends and roommates here.\nDear Fulbright, I sincerely hope that all children in Vietnam, even those who can not afford studying abroad, will one day experience an educational environment like this—one that nurtures intellectual curiosity, personal growth, and unwavering support for each other.</td>

      <td>It’s hard to choose from the hundreds of memories Fulbright has given me. But when I look back, one of the first things that comes to mind is when I was quarantined during my first months after moving to The Waterfront. It was an unforgettable experience—my roommates and I had to lean on each other as we got through the exhausting days of the pandemic, moving from the dorm to the quarantine hotel. We were all sick, running fevers and feeling drained, but we still shared medicine, cooked simple meals together, played card games to distract ourselves, and video-called friends in other rooms to lift each other’s spirits. Strangely enough, it was still a fun and meaningful time. Without it, we might not have grown so close. All that sharing and caring, especially when we were at our worst, gave me a sense of family in my very first year of college.</td>
      <td>Every minute I spent here became a cherished memory, as I was surrounded each day by friends who made me feel like my existence mattered. I'm deeply grateful to the Fine Art group for always being there at the end of each semester and to K11.07 for being my family. To all the friends who laughed, listened, supported, and stayed by my side—you made this journey unforgettable. I cried a lot during the entrance interview session (it's true), but I’ll always leave with a smile when I think of the people who made it all worthwhile.</td>

I can come to this point primarily because my IS faculty and peers never judged me for what I said; rather, we had the most healthy and dynamic discussions about any topic just to understand something. But when my thầy cô asked me "Why?", I would still be scared to death when I didn't know why =)) Sometimes I replied to thầy Thiết with the most stupid answers, and he'd just give up and explain one single thing for 2 hours. Or when cô Dung asked me "How?", I would just freeze, and my cardiac pacemaker would stop working for 2 seconds before I came up with the weirdest hypothesis ever. And she would definitely think and consider this idea for 5 seconds before giving me the right answer.</td>
      <td>At the heart of this journey, I believe that the person I am right now is shaped by so many fragments of my dearest friends and teachers and undeniably my family. My sciency version, genuine curiosity for life, and even life choice have been greatly inspired by the Integrated Sciences faculty, to whom I am forever in debt: cô Dung, cô Trang lớn, cô Trang bé, thầy Jesse, thầy Thiết, thầy Vân, cô Sam, and thầy Hùng. Because of them, I have been a learner and a thinker who will definitely spill the most useless facts about human physiology (like why you pee so much after an alcoholic drink) amidst a party. Without these people's support, I would not have the courage and determination to raise the standard for myself and pursue higher learning.\nAs I embrace the more humane part of me, my peers - my dear friends, colleagues, and mentors (anh/chị/bạn) have always been by my side. Thank you all for the random lab rants, Yakimono therapy sessions, late-night phone calls, and midnight support during sleepovers. You've taught me the most brainrot things ever while managing to be my strongest supporters for me and my intellectual journey.\nTo my parents – thank you for supporting me in every aspect of life, especially for each of my major decisions in life, even when you didn’t fully understand where they might take me. (Yes, I know you still call my major “Biotechnology” – and that’s okay).\nWhen I look back, I realize this journey never truly started until I enrolled in the course "Algae" in my first year's summer semester. Visiting faculty thầy Thiết and thầy Vân not only taught me about algae but also changed my perspective on how the world we're living in works. I started to see the beauty in everything rather than meaning in everything as I imagined the complicated molecular machineries happening beyond my bare eyes. A fallen leaf, my mother's tears when I came out, and me being happy when I listen to Taylor Swift. Sometimes I wonder what if I hadn't decided to drop the course 2D/3D to enroll in Algae. Would I be adrift? Would I be masking my cluelessness with humor and convincing myself that life has a meaning and I had not yet found it (I blame late puberty)?\nBut while meaning is just an illusion we created to fool ourselves that our life is important, I found these 4 years of mine meaningful. In this long journey, I don't learn from "Fulbright"; I learn from people who happen to be present in my life, and somehow, some of them happen to be at Fulbright. And if there's only one thing I learnt from Scientific Inquiry, it would be the difference between causation and correlation.\nAs this chapter closes and I am still at the beginning of my life, I recall what thầy Thiết once shared: "Who you are is defined by the values you're willing to struggle for." And I am definitely willing to struggle just to understand a glimpse of this weird world we are living in.</td>

      <td>Chắc chắn là Fulbright CIDO rồi.  \n\nMình lựa chọn CIDO vào những ngày chưa được học tại trường vì dịch Covid. Vỏn vẹn gần 10 con người đồng hành cùng nhau suốt mùa dịch, làm các dự án online, bonding online, meeting 1-1 để được catch up, rủ nhau đi thi,... để rồi suốt 4 năm đại học, qua nhiều nhiệm kỳ, mình có CIDO như một gia đình, và những người bạn thân nhất ở Fulbright cũng đến từ CIDO. \n\nGiờ đây CIDO đã có được những sự nhận diện, hiện diện và biết đến nhất định vì những giá trị CIDO tạo ra và một văn hoá CIDO rất chân thành, đầy thương mến. Tụi mình có Club of the year, President of the year, Event of the year,... trong nhiều năm liền, đó là thành quả nỗ lực và sự thương mến từ rất nhiều người trong cộng đồng Fulbright nói chung và CIDO nói riêng.\n\nNhưng hơn hểt, CIDO cho mình những giá trị con người mà mình sẽ không bao giờ quên được. Suốt thời gian dịch, chị Thu An và các chị Minh, chị Chi, chị Phụng vẫn tâm huyết làm một chuỗi training với nhiều trainer để tụi mình được học rất nhiều topic khác nhau. Cũng nhờ vậy mà tụi mình có những bài học đầu tiên, cũng như cùng với chị Thu An, mình làm đậm hơn career path passion của mình, dù giờ chỉ không theo nghề :"&gt; \n\nVà CIDO cũng cho mình những người, những chuyến đi, những hành trình đáng nhớ: Thuỷ Tiên, Thuỳ An, Phúc Thành, Thuỳ Dương, Quỳnh Mai, Phương Uyên,... rất nhiều người khác nhưng không liệt kê hết, nhưng Hiếu sẽ mãi nhớ mọi người ở trong tim.</td>
      <td>Hành trình của mình tại Fulbright gói gọn trong 3 điều : Là mình - Là người - Là điều mình cống hiến. \n\n"Là mình" ở đây ý chỉ mình tập trung lắng nghe để hiểu bản thân, tìm ra điều mình thích, là mình với phiên bản chân thành nhất trong cảm xúc, đam mê,... vì ở Fulbright là một môi trường đa dạng, ai cũng có những đam mê sở thích riêng, những sự ưu tú và nổi bật riêng, và cả những thành tựu riêng. Làm sao để giữa 1 cộng đồng như vậy, mình vẫn bình tĩnh với những giá trị của bản thân? Vẫn có quyền chọn lối đi riêng, vẫn được nhìn thế giới đầy hài hoà nhưng học trân trọng hơn những người bạn thật sự khiến mình thuộc về và vẫn bình tĩnh sống với điều mình chọn. Ở những ngày cuối đại học, mình có những bước đi sớm trong sự nghiệp cá nhân, và cả làm điều mình chưa từng nghĩ đó là làm capstone, nó cho mình được cảm nhận là mình rõ hơn bao giờ hết.\n\n"Là người" là chọn được cộng đồng mình thuộc về, dành toàn phần tâm sức để thấu hiểu, để đồng cảm để chia sẻ, để thấu hiểu. Đôi khi giữa 1 công đồng đa dạng, lắng nghe và thấu hiểu cho mình cơ hội để kết nối nhiều hơn. Nhớ hồi dịch tụi mình chơi Haloween với nhau, rồi vào năm học thì đi nhặt rác ở Kiên Giang, Vũng Tàu, đi làm thiện nguyện ở Đắk Lắk hoặc rong ruổi các con phố Sài Gòn để làm cơm từ thiện. Mình được cùng những người khác, học về con người, về thiện nguyện, nhìn con người ở nhiều góc độ, và từ đó kêu gọi được nhiều người cùng đồng hành hơn, và hơn nữa những môn học ở Fulbright không chỉ dạy về kỹ thuật, kỹ năng, đó còn là hành trình quay lại những điều cơ bản nhất của con người, về văn hoá, về hành vi, về mong cầu,... \n\n"Là điều mình cống hiến". Mang CIDO trở thành Club of the Year, duy trì các thế hệ đều đặn và đông dần lên qua nhiều năm là điều đầu tiên mình luôn tự hào. Được làm nhiều công việc có ích cho xã hội là thứ hai. Luôn say hi, luôn mong cầu giúp đỡ, chia sẻ với những người bạn của mình là thứ ba. Đấy là những điều cống hiến đã tạo nên mình của hôm nay. Dẫu cho có nhiều mục tiêu về sự nghiệp khác nhưng những điều đó của bản thân tại Fulbright đã cho mình nhiều cảm hứng sống, để từng ngày đều là từng ngày ý nghĩa.</td>

I’ll never forget our very first Orientation week—held online due to COVID-19—yet still so complete. Among all the sessions, the one that changed me the most was Boundary Setting. It shaped the way every Fulbright student treats others, and it continues to influence how I navigate relationships today.\n\nFrom Residential Life to Wellness and Learning Support, try-out events to work-study programs—every experience has helped me grow, often even more than academic lectures. My first WSP, working as an IT Assistant, was especially transformative. I still remember the first time I met the IT staff, I nervously asked: “Will it be extremely embarrassing if someone asks a technical question and you don’t know the answer?” One of them simply said, “It’s normal.” That moment gave me the confidence to show up in class platforms, to fix things when I could, and to ask for help when I couldn’t.\n\nThat role opened the door to meeting so many faculty and staff members, forming relationships that turned into unforgettable memories—trips together, grabbing cá viên chiên in District 3, even staying in touch after they resigned. It also led me to become an AA Assistant, where I explored the behind-the-scenes world of university administration. It felt like a sandbox for my younger self, who once imagined growing up to be an "office worker."</td>
      <td>The journey only truly began when we moved to offline learning in Spring 2022 and moved to the Waterfront. Living in shared dorms taught me how to embrace diversity, resolve conflicts, and accept that being different is not just okay—it’s valuable. I came into Fulbright as an 18-year-old still unsure of myself. But through my peers, I met the real me, and learn to embrace my unique values.\n\nIt was these amazing roommates who encouraged me to run for Student Council President in the AY23–24. I never imagined myself leading a team—I’d never done it before—but they believed in me. And their belief gave me the courage to believe in myself.\n\nAnd then, there’s Running Club. A place where it doesn’t matter if I run slowly—or walk most of the time. The energy, the laughter, the encouragement from both friends and coaches made every run (and every walk) feel meaningful. Without them, the past few years could have felt dark and directionless. I always finished 21km right at the cut off time, yet they never make fun of me when I said I want to finish 42km before I graduate. I never thought I could become one who finds joy in running, but now, I am. And the motto we hold for running applies to every other achievement in life: take small steps, consistently.\n\nIt’s not about what I’ve achieved—but about the belief I now carry within me. Fulbright has given me the faith that, whatever comes my way, I’ll be ready to face it—and I’ll nail it.</td>

My future is uncertain, in a world of fluctuations, wars, economic recession, genocides, political changes, technological breakthroughs (or setbacks). I have some plans for the future, but I'm fearful as fuck. Still, if there's something I would take with me in my Fulbright days, it would be worth-telling, life-changing, thought-provoking stories. I've learned to empathize with others, share their pains and glories, and be kind through stories. I've learned important lessons to carry on in my upcoming journey.

Chị Trâm and thầy Ian are the few who witnessed my academic progression at Fulbright, to put up a fair share of critique while encouraging me towards a bigger sea. Their academic lessons very much transmute into my personal life, an anchorage for me to keep swimming forward. Meanwhile, Nhi Phan, Tuấn Kiệt, Diệu Trang, Tony, Đắc Hoàng disentangle me as a thinker. I learn to slow down my reasoning, and to listen while appreciating that one's experience of life is just as riveting as academic curiosity. And lastly, Linh Trang teaches me to be a better human, however good I am at rationalizing. Some things are meant to be felt and embodied. Never in the last four years have these flows been such visceral and never in my life have I learned so much.</td>
      <td>I still remember vividly my essay application to Fulbright 4 years ago, which discussed Jimin's anatomy of dance in confluence with Carl Jung's theory. Knowing nothing back then, not even myself and my future, I latched onto BTS and their spiritual animal - a purple whale. It was not until 2 years of struggling later in the Psychology department did everything come together. One of my friends 'forced' me into Chị Trâm's ethnography class, which then prompted me further to examine the metaphysics of dance, the rigorous and experimental side of which I could not imagine to have done it. Such an intellectual endeavour continued robustly under chị Trâm's mentorship, only to cultimate in my Capstone thesis in Social Studies, on studying the Holy Whale worshipped in Quy Nhơn. During this time, I also co-founded the Social Studies Symposium, which unexpectedly takes the theme of purple. Through 4 years, that lonely whale, in BTS's 'Whalien 52' song is no longer an alien. He has found resonance across different voices and personalities at Fulbright. He now can come to sing with many others, a note of no beginning or end.</td>

As I walked home along that familiar aisle on F2, I couldn’t shake the memory of that misty afternoon when warm, red sunlight lit the surface of the emerald lake. I paused, speechless, as a slow wave of melancholy washed over me, hinting that perhaps I was leaving this place soon. We spent so much time strolling around the lake. My fellow math friends would often join me after our thesis has grown tired of being written by us, and our Professor would treat the gang to ice cream. I even remember those slightly awkward practice sessions by the lake with my folks—singing away even as people passed by. These memories are the ones I’ve chosen to keep, even if my memory isn’t the best. Friends, I’m not sure how long this Yearbook will survive, but I’ll be a bit cheesy and say that I’m likely going to miss y’all.</td>
      <td>Realistically, I know I won’t be seeing most of you as often in the future. It saddens me to remember when I could spend an hour on F2 just to catch a glimpse of so many familiar faces in our small school. I wish everyone a joyful life, and perhaps every now and then, we can get together to appreciate the paths we’ve taken. Honestly, I believe a bright future awaits us all.</td>

      <td>To Bao Khang of 2021,\n\nThis is your future self writing to you, looking back on your college journey with awe and pride. You’d be amazed at how far you’ve come.\n\nDo you remember when you first applied to Fulbright? One of the essay topics you chose was about Fear - fear of not being good enough, of doubting yourself. And yet, four years later, look at what you’ve achieved. You were once someone who rarely took the initiative, especially when it came to teamwork, one of your biggest challenges.\n\nBack then, stepping out of my comfort zone seemed impossible. You hesitated to seek out opportunities. But now, looking back, you've built a path filled with growth and quiet victories. Who would’ve thought you'd end up leading a tennis community on campus, encouraging others to chase a green ball for hours with a racket? Or that you’d keep pushing forward, applying for jobs despite failures and uncertainties?\n\nYou’ve come a long way—from a hesitant high school student to a more grounded, emotionally mature young adult. Not only your thoughts but your perspective have changed through the experiences that you have encountered. Now, with just 34 days left at Fulbright, your time here is coming to a close. Graduation is just around the corner, and with it, a new chapter begins. There will be no more classes or campus life, but in its place comes the challenge yet excitement of standing on your own two feet. It’s intimidating, yes, but also full of possibility. \n\nThank you, Fulbright, for being such an amazing part of my life. For giving me a place to meet incredible friends, mentors, and professors who have shaped me in ways I will always carry with me. This will forever remain one of the most meaningful chapters of my life.\n\nI’ll see you soon, Khang. It’s time to move forward. Keep your head high, and just keep swimming. \n\nWith love and pride,\n\nNguyễn Bảo Khang\n(Graduated from Fulbright University Vietnam)</td>

Because of that, I looked for more particular courses that served my purpose of studying Finance, and studied other particular courses. After 4 years of staying at Fulbright, I understand that to make an idea come true, one needs to understand very particular practicalities, or else a contribution would either lack in depth, or wouldn't be useful.</td>

I cherish the community that I have at this school, everyone helps me understand more about human values, to love and understand being human.\n\nThank you to my close friends, who were there when I was sick, when I was depressed, when I was struggling and when I was happy. Thank you for letting me know that in my life there are people who love me so much. And love in a very unique way: freely, sincerely, delicately and importantly, always respecting me as a human being. I thank you.\n\nThank you to the teachers at Fulbright. Despite my less-than-ideal classroom experiences, I am grateful to have met educators who respect knowledge and respect students. I never imagined that there would be days when I would chat with my professors, have lunch with them, ask them how they are doing, or tell them about the things I do in my daily life.\n\nAmong the educators here, I would like to give special mention to Dr. Pamela Corey Nguyen and Dr. Luong Ngoc Tram. For me, these are the two professors who shaped my academic direction, helped me find my values, and entered research paths I never thought of: Art History, Visual Culture, Photography, and Ethnographic Practice. I am grateful to Dr. Corey for her dedication, for the thoughtful feedback and advice she gave me in many of her classes at Fulbright as well as for my Capstone Project. I am grateful to Dr. Tram Luong (I often call her Ms. Tram) for nurturing my love and knowledge of photography, connecting my knowledge and practice of photography with further academic interests and always pushing me to become more critical and intentional in everything I do. I also love and appreciate the remaining teachers of AMS and Social Studies, Literature for always living so close to us, allowing us to experience a cozy academic environment. I learned a lot from them, especially for setting a premise for myself to pursue academia after much confusion and skepticism before.\n\nThank you to my classmates and like-minded comrades, special gratitude to AMS students after all the projects, assignments, and experiences we have had.\n\nAnd I thank this school for the uncertainties it has faced. Honestly, this school showed me that with the positions it has, no matter how much uncertainty it faces, the most important lesson is to think about how to overcome. After all, I saw myself growing up not only in comfort and protection, but also in challenges at Fulbright.</td>

I believe, like Dumbledore has said: “Help will always be given at Fulbright to those who ask for it!” \nTo me, Fulbrighters are endlessly curious thinkers who refuse to be confined by disciplinary boundaries—boldly studying Math and Literature, Computer Science and Psychology at the same time.\nFulbrighters are unique individuals, each on our own path, united by a passion for learning and a willingness to share their stories and experiences for hours on end. We are supportive companions—always ready to listen, offer advice, and cheer one another on through tough times.\nWe are also remarkably brave and ambitious—taking the lead on crowdfunding campaigns, fundraisers, showcases, symposiums, and more. Faculty and staff go to great lengths to create growth opportunities for students. To the brothers and sisters from Fulbright’s departments—your unwavering dedication and kindness whenever we needed support have been truly incredible. Especially, I want to thank chi Lan, chi Minh, chi Hoa, chi Linh at CEI for your support, where I have worked for 1.5 years. \nThese experiences and connections will remain among the most treasured assets I carry with me after graduation.</td>
      <td>Looking back, my journey of Fulbright is indeed a rollercoaster, with many ups and downs. \nThere were times of multiple personal crises when I felt completely lost—overwhelmed by a sense of directionlessness and meaninglessness. I used to be a diligent student, but then I neglected classes and assignment. I used to be determined and passionate, but I started missing deadlines and promises. In a panic, I kept myself as busy as possible, but deep down, I wasn’t sure what any of it was really for. \nFortunately, I wasn’t alone on that journey—I was supported by friends, family, and mentors. Thanks to them, I found the light within myself to move forward. I learned to make peace with my past self. I learned to believe in my future self. And I learned to cherish the present.\nI committed to rebuilding from simple things but I have forgot: eating 3 meals and sleep 7 hours a day, studying at library for better focus, not skipping classes, not missing assignments, and submitting work on time, mastering Outlook Calendar, taking notes and reviewing notes, attending office hours and events, reaching out and seeking help from departments, working out regularly, doing work study, internships, and research paper, joining Student Council, setting short-term and long-term goals. And most importantly, I managed to have fun with friends and enjoy life. \nI look forward to what’s next with hope and curiosity!  \n\n</td>

It’s not just about being surrounded by kind people — it’s about how we hold space for each other’s contradictions, complexities, and questions. There’s a culture here where differences aren’t just tolerated but embraced. Whether in a late-night dorm conversation, a community circle, or a heated classroom debate, I always felt like I belonged — not in spite of my individuality, but because of it.\n\nFulbright gave me not only the freedom to learn in my own way but the courage to unlearn, to be wrong, and to keep showing up. That, to me, is humans of Fulbright: real stories, real people, real growth.</td>
      <td>When I first stepped into Fulbright, I wasn’t looking for answers — I was looking for permission to explore. And Fulbright gave me just that.\n\nIt didn’t mold me into a fixed shape. It gave me space to unfold.\n\nThe authentic learning culture encouraged me to try, fail, rethink, and design my own learning process. Professors didn’t just lecture — they listened. Classmates didn’t compete — they collaborated. I didn’t just study, I grew.\n\nThe diversity of thought here was not decorative, it was foundational. From anthropology to applied mathematics, from philosophy circles to activism workshops, I found myself navigating different ways of thinking and being. It reshaped how I approached knowledge — not as a trophy to claim, but a lens to question the world.\n\nThe collaborative spirit at Fulbright meant everything. No matter where you turned — the Library, Student Life, the classroom, even the Crescent Lake  — you’d find someone who’d walk beside you, share a laugh, or gently challenge your ideas.\n\nAbove all, it was the community of empathy that transformed me. Not just being heard, but being truly seen. Whether it was in a office hour, a community check-in, or a quiet look exchanged in a tough moment — I realized what a rare thing it is to feel both free and supported at once.\n\nI will leave Fulbright not with a fixed identity, but a toolkit: to listen deeply, to collaborate across difference, to fail gracefully, to think with heart. I carry forward a belief in education as transformation, not transaction.\n\nTo those who are just beginning: don’t try to fit in. Be curious. Be weird. Be kind. Your journey will not look like anyone else’s — and that’s the point.\n\nThank you, Fulbright — for not shaping me, but for letting me shape myself.</td>

      <td>To be honest, this part feels more like writing in a diary — finally, no grading criteria after four years.\n\nSo, what do I cherish the most?\nWhen I sat down to write this, the first thing that came to mind was my friends and family. They’ve been such a big part of not just my time at university, but my whole life.\n\nI’m deeply thankful for the amazing community I found here at Fulbright. It’s the people — the ones who laughed with me, stressed with me, and grew with me — that made this journey unforgettable.\n\nTo all my friends, I’m wishing you nothing but happiness and success in whatever comes next. You’ve made this experience truly special.</td>
      <td>It’s been such a great journey here. I still remember the time I submitted my Fulbright application — it was Spring cycle, 23:59, literally one minute before the deadline. Then came the interview round, and somehow, I made it. I became a Fulbright student.\n\nMy first semester was completely online. I made a few friends through online discussions and group projects, which felt weird at first, but somehow worked. When I found out we’d be moving to the dorms the next year, I was nervous but also excited to actually meet people in real life. And dorm life turned out to be amazing. I met so many great friends, especially my two roommates — Kyle and Khang Bi. I spent most of that first year at the Waterfront residence with them.\n\nIn our second year, we started making new friends from Docklands, and by the third year, six of us — Kyle, Phu, Khang, Tommy, and Luan — moved out together to River Panorama. That apartment became home. We made so many memories there.\n\nI want to thank every single friend I’ve made — you’ve all given me some of the best, most unforgettable memories. And especially Kyle — I once said that all the money, time, and effort I spent here would be worth it just to meet him and become close friends. That still sums it up perfectly.\n\nAlso, huge thanks to my family — thank you for always being there and supporting me through everything.\n\nAnd yeah, that’s pretty much it. I’ll leave the rest of this space for my favorite photos. For me, pictures don’t need to be 4K or anything fancy — as long as the people in them are happy, that’s all that really matters.</td>

Cảm ơn chị Trâm vì tất cả những cuộc trò chuyện mình đã có với nhau. Và cảm ơn tất cả những kết nối mình đã có trongnhững năm tháng mình gắn bó với Fulbright. Không có mọi người, hành trình của mình ở Fulbright sẽ không thể nào đáng nhớ được đến thế. Cuối cùng, cảm ơn Fulbright đã để bông hoa nơi mình nở rộ theo cách dịu dàng và rực rỡ nhất nha!</td>

Mình và CIDO đã từng rong ruổi khắp các đường phố Sài Gòn trong những chuyến Community Sharing, cho đến những tỉnh thành lân cận như Tà Lài - Đồng Nai, Vũng Tàu, đến các tỉnh miền Tây như Long An, Kiên Giang và đặc biệt hơn cả chính là chuyến đi xa nhất đến Đăk Lăk – quê của mình. Mình đã vô cùng tự hào khi lần đầu tiên có thể dẫn một nhóm bạn ở Đại học về quê của mình, ăn những món ăn ngon, trải nghiệm những thứ đặc trưng ở quê và làm một dự án cộng đồng ý nghĩa cùng Câu lạc bộ ở trường cấp 3 mình. Còn nhớ năm đó CIDO tụi mình không có quá nhiều tiền để thuê khách sạn ở, 17 đứa ngủ chấp nhận ở tại nhà của mình – căn nhà tự nhiên có tận 17 đứa con, cái phòng ngủ nhỏ xí tự nhiên cũng nhét được tận 7 đứa, rồi thì phòng khách, phòng ăn trở nên nhộn nhịp hơn bao giờ hết. Đó là những kỉ niệm mà mình sẽ chẳng bao giờ quên khi đồng hành cùng CIDO, cùng những người bạn đến từ những vùng miền khác nhau mà mình đã có duyên gặp được tại Fulbright.</td>
      <td>Hành trình của mình với Fulbright sẽ luôn là câu chuyện được kể đi kể lại với những người bạn, người em, người đồng đội đồng hành của mình trong suốt cuộc đời khi nói về khoảng thời gian học đại học. Mình biết đến Fulbright nhờ cái duyên khi có cơ hội được nói chuyện với chị Hiền (Co24) khi 2 đứa đang là học sinh cấp 3. Mình biết yêu Fulbright khi nghe về câu chuyện thành lập, triết lý giáo dục và sứ mệnh đóng góp cho giáo dục Việt Nam, thấy giá trị mà bản thân mong muốn rất match với trường, mình dồn hết sức để apply vào và chinh phục trường bằng mọi giá. Rồi mình cũng từng tạm dừng và thậm chí muốn dừng luôn hành trình này khi gặp quá nhiều thử thách trong học tập, trong các mối quan hệ bạn bè, sự mông lung, vô định giữa dịch Covid trầm trọng ngay năm đầu tiên đến với Fulbright. Nhưng rồi sau tất cả, mình quyết định cho bản thân một cơ hội nữa để thử lại, mở rộng lòng hơn để đón nhận những trải nghiệm và thử thách “uncertainty” mà mình gặp phải, Co25 gặp phải và ngay cả trường cũng luôn phải đối mặt.\n\nNhân đây, mình cũng xin gửi lời cảm ơn sâu sắc đến tất cả những người bạn, người anh chị, thầy cô và các staff của trường đã đồng hành và hỗ trợ mình rất nhiều từ những ngày biết đến trường, apply, đậu, học, gap year, đến khi quay lại, bắt đầu lại rồi tốt nghiệp. Cảm ơn Minh Hiếu và chị Mã Y Vân đã là những người bạn đầu tiên đồng hành cùng em trong những ngày đầu quay lại Fulbright sau khi gap year. Cảm ơn Minh Hiếu vì đã mang CIDO đến với tao, giúp tao cởi mở và kết nối nhiều hơn với khóa Co25. Cảm ơn CIDO, đặc biệt là khóa core AY22-23 gồm Thủy Tiên, Thùy Dương, Thùy An, core AY23-24 gồm Như Thảo, Nguyên Anh, Hạnh Nguyên, Thư Bùi, Minh Hiệp và các bạn bè, anh, chị, em ở CIDO các khóa đã hỗ trợ và cho mình những khoảng thời gian thật đáng nhớ. Cảm ơn hội Nhà 135B Waterfront (Cốm, Ngọc Linh, Hoàng Vy, Nguyên Anh, Thư Bùi, Phương Hà, Minh Thảo, Tăng Linh Trang, Jass) vì đã là những người bạn Co26 đầu tiên và cho tao cảm giác gia đình tuyệt vời nhất khi sống xa nhà. Cảm ơn Khoa Quách và Ngọc Yên vì đã luôn yêu thương, thấu hiểu và tạo nên “Tết - Tâm - Tình”... Sau tất cả, con xin cảm ơn bố mẹ đã đồng ý và cho con được theo đuổi hành trình này. Và rất nhiều tình cảm từ những người bạn học Arts, học VS và các thầy cô, anh chị staff dành đến em, biết ơn và trân trọng thật nhiều.</td>

Absolutely. Wanted to give up? More times than I can count. But somehow, somewhere deep inside, the passion kept burning. It wasn’t just me anymore—it was my teammates, their encouragement, their late-night problem solving, their belief in me when I doubted myself the most. That energy? That’s what got me through.And when I look back now, I can still feel it—the exhaustion, the relief, the sheer disbelief that I actually survived it. But I did. And that course? It didn’t just teach me robotics. It taught me grit.</td>

At first, I was focused on the technical side—pure classes like Electronics, Robots… and I felt stuck in that. It was all about circuits, code, and mechanics.But as time passed, I started seeing the bigger picture. Engineering isn’t just about assembling things, it’s about managing work, understanding people, and recognizing their needs. The technical skills? They’re just tools. What really matters is the attitude—the mindset, the willingness to learn, adapt, and lead.I became more open, more aware of the human side of engineering. And when I look back now, I realize that DST—the class I barely paid much attention to in the beginning—turned out to be the most impactful one. It shaped the way I think, the way I approach problems, and the way I see the world as an engineer.</td>

The idea of rigorous academics, challenging courses, and unfamiliar environments was both intimidating and exciting. But what I didn’t expect was the incredible community and the friendships that would define my experience here.\n\nFulbright has given me the courage to apply for my first internship in my first year, which opened up so many opportunities I never imagined I would have. Balancing a full-time job with full coursework was not a pink dream — it was nights of sleeplessness, burnout, and self-doubt. But every time I fell, my friends were there for me. They didn’t just cheer me up with their words; they helped me catch up with school, proving that everything would be fine. This experience truly reflected the spirit of Fulbright: pushing boundaries while supporting one another through it all. And I am forever grateful to have met all of you.\n\nFulbright has changed me in ways I never anticipated. It taught me not only how to solve complex problems but also how to approach challenges with resilience and creativity. I learned that learning isn't just about the answers — it’s about the journey, the failures, the breakdowns, and the breakthroughs along the way. Through every lecture, group project, and late-night coding session, I’ve discovered more about my own limits, strengths, and passions.\n\nAs I move forward, I aim to continue embracing challenges head-on and applying what I’ve learned here — both academically and personally. The experiences, the friendships, and the lessons will continue to shape who I become.\n\nA huge thank you to my professors, especially thầy Hiếu and thầy Linh, who pushed me to stretch my limits while still placing trust in me. To my friends, who stuck by me in the toughest times and celebrated with me in the best.\n\nHere’s to the future, and all the moments yet to come. May our paths cross again.</td>

Thanks to the incredible people I met there, those days were filled with humor, unexpected joy, and the kind of camaraderie that stays with me long after the uniforms are gone. \n\nWe sang together, watched the rain fall, studied side by side, and shared countless conversations.

I hope we remain, not just as classmates or colleagues, but as people who once meant something real to each other, and hopefully, always will.\nPlease don’t be strangers. If our paths cross again in this vast world, I hope you’ll come say hello.</td>

Those friends took me on group trips to several provinces in Vietnam, supported my first love, and comforted me after my breakup. They gave me the courage to take my first worldwide AI competition from which I had completely changed my mind regarding my studies. They were the ones that I supported as a study buddy but, at the same time, were also my teachers of resilience and willingness. They helped me to study, review my graduate school applications, introduced me to job opportunities, and even challenged my dream so I could understand more about what would be the most suitable for me. Besides them, the CS and Applied Mathematics faculties are the ones I also want to say thank you. They challenged me with difficult problems and questions, not just for their courses, but for my career and study choices as well. However, at the same time, they are the ones who guided me to find the right answers to those questions. I still treasure a traditional Vietnamese saying, which is "Không Thầy đố mày làm nên" - "No guide, no realization". To me, these professors are the best guiders that I have ever had at Fulbright. Without them, I doubt that I can be what I am now.</td>

You can do this, it's 4 years, 1 failed course won't matter that much (Don't let it be 4 failed course though)\nTo the professors: Thank you immensely for your enthusiasm, your care, and your effort. God knows we were difficult students, but thank you for trying to teach us, thank you for caring about us, thank you for noticing and offering help when we struggled. You're amazing, and we're always grateful to have met you. May your finances be stable, your work-life be balanced, your family healthy, and your life be happy and fulfilling.</td>

      <td>The people — always the people.\n\nFulbright was the place where I met strangers who turned into teammates, friends, and sometimes heartbreaks. Some drifted in and out, some stuck around for a while, and a few stayed for good. But every single one left something with me — a lesson, a laugh, a late-night talk, a moment I didn’t know I’d hold onto.\n\nGroup projects were... something else. From smooth-sailing dream teams to chaotic messes that left me editing slides at 2AM — I weirdly loved it all. Even the worst projects ended with a shared meal and conversations that made me feel seen. That’s the magic of Fulbright: even when things go wrong, people show up.\n\nI think most about those unexpected friendships — the ones that started with a random chat, a shared playlist, or just a feeling that we got each other. We were all so different, but somehow, it worked. Some of those friendships ended quietly, some painfully. But I’m thankful for every one of them.\n\nAnd to the ones still here with me now — thank you. You’ve been my cheerleaders, my crisis hotline, my people. You made Fulbright more than just a university. You made it mine.\n\nI’ll carry all of you with me. Always.</td>
      <td>It’s been a wild, beautiful, and unforgettable ride.\n\nI didn’t have some grand plan when I applied to Fulbright. It was a spontaneous decision — my high school friends mentioned it, I googled it out of curiosity. “Liberal Arts”? “US-Vietnam relations”? I had no clue what those even meant. But as I scrolled through Fulbright’s website, something clicked. I pictured myself there. I clicked “Apply.”\n\nThat one impulsive moment brought me to a place that changed everything.\n\nI entered Fulbright as a wide-eyed freshman, unsure of my English, emailing Learning Support just to ask for a slot in the Bridge Program. I wasn’t from a “gifted school,” hadn’t experienced international-style education — I felt lost, intimidated, and like I didn’t belong. I messaged strangers with “@fulbright.edu.vn” in their bios just to feel less alone.\n\nThen, life started to happen. First friends, first classes, first late-night talks that spiraled into something more. I was overwhelmed — by the culture, the constant push for reflection, the discussions, the intellectual rush. I tried to keep up, but somewhere in the chaos, I lost a bit of myself.\n\nIt took time — and a lot of mistakes — to learn that I didn’t have to change who I was to thrive here. Sophomore year taught me how to slow down, to be patient with the process, to say “no” when something didn’t align with my values. I started choosing what mattered, not just what was impressive.\n\nBut Fulbright wasn’t all heavy. Some of my best memories live in Fulbright Event Hub, Fulbright Tennis, and The Luminous. I found joy in organizing, in leading, in building something with friends. The laughs, the stress, the breakthroughs, the tears — all of it stitched together something so real. Those moments will stay with me forever.\n\nAnd somewhere along the way, Kyle. We started as classmates, then friends, and now — partners in every sense. We’ve studied, led the Tennis Club, rewritten our resumes a hundred times together. We’ve celebrated wins, survived losses, and stood by each other through it all. I’ll always be grateful to Fulbright for bringing us together.\n\nNow, at the end of this four-year journey, I see someone different in the mirror. Someone who takes ownership of his life, who’s willing to take risks, fall down, and get back up again. Someone who dares to dream a little bigger.\n\nI came in not knowing what Fulbright really was. Now, I leave knowing that Fulbright is a part of me. And I’ll always be proud to say: I’m a Fulbrighter.</td>

If the council depends on the school, it is like a labor union funded by private corporate: it is contradictory in principle. My time in student council taught me that, showed me that, and I walk away feeling a lot more relief with less what-ifs and less savior complex. I am grateful.</td>

      <td>For me to study at Fulbright, my parents made a significant sacrifice. That understanding has stayed with me from the very beginning, so when I moved to Saigon, I made a promise to myself: I would become financially independent as soon as possible to lessen the burden. From the first year, I threw myself into work. I worked relentlessly and achieved my goals. \n\nHowever, by the end of my third year, something hit me: I had lost what people often call "the college experience." I had no study group. No road trips with friends. No late-night heart-to-hearts. I hadn’t spent time with professors to truly explore ideas, or with classmates to build deep connections. I had missed out on the things that make college unforgettable. \n\nSo I decided to open my heart—to people, to experiences. I paused the race up the corporate ladder and shifted my focus back to school. For the first time, I traveled to the beach with my friends. I pulled an all-nighter with a study group, cramming for an exam as the sun came up. I danced, played sports, stayed out late, laughed until I cried. For the first time, I felt like a real college student. \n\nI’m truly grateful for the people who walked into my life during this time. Friends who listened, who stayed, who supported me through every storm and celebrated every small joy. Professors who reminded me why I love to learn. And my parents, whose quiet sacrifices continue to be the foundation of everything I do.</td>

      <td>Saying that it was memorable is an understatement. I never inteneded to make friends at the start of university at all, and for 2.5 years... that was what happened: Moving through schoolwork while ignoring potential connections. Bascially, I was passing through like I never existed.\n\nThings changed as I noticed how easy it was to connect with people in here. \n\nThe turning point was when I attended Introduction to Video &amp; Film Production in Spring 2023. I began to feel confident about sharing my ideas with other people, and so the last few years were extremely fun as I up the ante in many of my film and creative projects, trying to surpise/discomfort them as much as I can. Before I knew it, I had more friends than I could ever imagine.\n\nMaybe I could have done this all along, but the more important lesson here is that I only need to focus on the future and its potential and don't let "what ifs" and regrets of the past slow you down as FUV's friendliness allows you to progress at your own pace. As long as I've gained something, the past was nothing.\n</td>

Or when I worked with Quyen, Vy, Zoe, and London on a research project about war veterans. I joined community service projects in Cu Lao Dung and Trường Tre, went on adventurous trips with my Frisbee crew and sisterhood circle, even traveled to Hong Kong. I was part of so many interdisciplinary teams. I found myself through pushing my limits—and seeing my friends grow and feel empowered to do the same made me genuinely happy. I truly lived my university life to the fullest. I overcame many challenges. And now, it’s all done. What a journey. Hooray!</td>
      <td>Fulbright came into my life during the Covid year, when everything was under lockdown. I saw in Fulbright the very core values I had been shaping during my two gap years. When I received my offer, I was the first Co25 student to move into the dorm at Waterfront, living with second, third, and fourth-year students. That was truly a special experience—it allowed me to genuinely feel the cross-cohort spirit and understand what Fulbright is really about.\nFulbright has changed me a lot, especially intellectually (with a stronger focus on Western perspectives). It gave me the courage to dive into Engineering and also pursue my childhood dream of studying the Arts (even if I’m not particularly great at it).\nWhat I hope to do in the future is to live kindly and compassionately with my community—to stand strong and create a positive impact through the work I do. I hope I’ll live wildly, stay true to myself, conquer any challenges that come my way, and face everything with the utmost bravery.</td>

I wonder how you’re doing. Are you working a dream job? Or has life taken you somewhere completely different? I hope whatever it is, you’re still chill, still able to smile at small things, and still kind to yourself when things don’t go as planned.\n\nThank you for not being afraid to open your heart here. It’s this place, these people, and these countless little moments that are shaping who you’re becoming. Fulbright isn’t just a school to me. It’s where I learned that I don’t have to have everything figured out. That it’s okay to not know, to be curious, to change, and to grow. I’m thankful for this journey and for the people who have walked it with me. To my friends who walked beside me these 4 years, I don’t know if by then we’ll still hang out, or if life will pull us in different directions. But even if we don’t see each other often, I’ll always be grateful for the days we had. \n\nI hope in the future I still remember how good it felt to belong somewhere, to be surrounded by people who made these years unforgettable.\n\nFrom cô nàng “than dữ” tammy w love,</td>

It was also the time we struggled with changing locations, from the edges of District 7 to even Binh Chanh, just to find a court with VAT support. Finding the right coach while managing a tight budget and welcoming players of all levels with the hope of winning a medal seemed like an impossible assignment to us back then.\n\nA year later, I was heading to the court on a drizzly evening, my heart already bubbling with excitement since the day before. The fact that our club was still alive after all this time filled me with joy. Who could have imagined that even individuals who never had time for sports would find their way to us? That some would gather at six in the morning just to play a few games before classes? That we would travel together to tournaments and return with laughter and stories that would live longer than any medal?</td>

Every student, every professor, and every staff member I have met and talked to at Fulbright are so unique, yet to me, they share one thing in common: they all inspire me in one way or another. Thanks to them, for the first time in my life, I learn to truly embrace myself. Thanks to them, I learn that every emotion I and others have is valid. Thanks to them, learning has become a meaningful journey of trying, failing, and then keeping trying.</td>

I thank you all for treating me with kindness and calm, no matter how annoyed I can be at times. Those meals together, those karaoke nights, and hangout parties were always my childhood dreams, and you guys made them come true. \nTo my MVCS group: Up to now, this is still the most unforgettable groupwork experience I have ever had. The project itself taught me so many things and gave me the chance to talk with people I'd never thought I'd meet in my life. Fyi, sometimes I still open the video we made, rewatch it, and cry. More than that, it's not simply students teaming up to complete a school project, but it's how some of my most valuable friendships start, and I cannot be grateful enough for that.\nTo thầy Thi Lưu, cô Nga, thầy Graeme, and all members of the Dance 101 course: My journey at Fulbright did not start very well. I struggled to feel truly comfortable going to school and attending classes. But thanks to you, going to school, attending classes, and talking to professors have no longer been intimidating, and I've finally felt at home at Fulbright.\nAnd to all Fulbrighters I've been lucky to talk to: cảm ơn vì đã là một phần thanh xuân đáng nhớ của Lan Thanh!</td>

      <td>“Voiceless” was the title of my entrance essay to Fulbright. It talked about the unheard stories of villains in fairy tales and how I empathize with them for being a misfit right in my own home. Bad versus evil, Ian must be glad that his teaching about “slave morality” touched me deeply. I started as a tempered high school kid trying to get myself out of the home where I felt misunderstood. Now, I find myself back in that same place, transforming both the love and pain into arts that I hold dear. I no longer want to purge the bad memories or cover them up with new ones. “Ethnographic gold,” chị Trâm would say, reminding me of how I can see through these bad memories and faded pain to learn more about my lineage. \r\n\r\nNow, I consider myself an intellectual nomad and an art practitioner who pays close attention to established institutions to pose questions about agency, identity, and phenomenology. Blending ethnographic works and art making, I see myself as a channeller, through which social forces materialize as visual patterns, sound waves, and words. In Bodies That Become Spatial (2024), a series of 30 low-exposure photographs, me and Hoang (my roommate) turned the Exit hall, a site where identities are suspended, into a workshop of meaning-making, spinning webs of light that stands in for the morphology of identities. In The Playgrounds (2025), a two-minute stereo audio mix, I cast myself in a self-made urban horror movie, grappling with the compressing adulthood in an exploitative neoliberal cityscape. Recently, with a new interest in making gastronomic reviews, I examined the aesthetics and taste of food reviewers including myself. Getting to know Michelin’s entangled history of being both a global gastronomic curator and a rubber baron with various plantations in Indochina, I wrote a preliminary research paper to explore how Michelin employs aesthetics and mystification to dissociate from its colonial history in Indochina, reframing its identity through the particular language of global culinary excellence.</td>

      <td>What I cherish most about Fulbright is the freedom to reinvent myself. It’s a place where there are no set paths, allowing me to explore new interests and redefine who I am. At Fulbright, I can be a scholar, an artist, or an activist without the pressure of fitting into one box. The freedom to fail has been key to this reinvention. Unlike traditional academic settings, where failure often feels like a setback, here it’s seen as part of the learning process. I’m encouraged to experiment and take risks without the fear of being judged. This has helped me grow academically and personally. Fulbright has allowed me to branch out beyond my original field of study, blending multiple disciplines that enrich my thinking. It’s given me the chance to explore different sides of myself—both as a student and as an individual. I’ve learned to embrace vulnerability, something I didn’t do before, and I’ve grown more open-minded and compassionate. Beyond academics, Fulbright has helped me understand my place in Vietnam and my role in the country’s future. It’s a space where I can challenge ideas, reflect on my identity, and contribute to a larger conversation about the world. The autonomy to shape my own education has been empowering. Fulbright doesn’t just offer a rigid curriculum; I’ve been able to pursue what excites me and take ownership of my learning. This flexibility has been crucial in my personal growth.</td>
      <td>I can still remember the first day I stepped onto the Fulbright campus: excited, nervous, and maybe just a little bit overwhelmed. I was stepping into an environment that was totally new to me. But as soon as I walked through the doors, I felt something different. It wasn’t just the beautiful campus or the impressive facilities, it was the energy. The energy of people who were as excited to learn and explore as I was, people who weren’t afraid to challenge ideas and push boundaries.\n\nWhen I first came to Fulbright, I thought I knew exactly what I wanted. I had my major, my goals, my expectations. But what I didn’t know was that Fulbright would change everything. It’s here that I learned how to reinvent myself. I started with one set of ideas, but I’ve evolved so much since then, academically, personally, and creatively. Fulbright gave me the space to try things I never would have attempted before. To explore new passions, meet people from different walks of life, and dive into fields I never thought would interest me. It pushed me to be a better version of myself, more confident, more open-minded, and more willing to embrace change and uncertainty.\n\nThere were moments, of course, when I doubted myself. Moments when I questioned my path or wondered if I was making the right choices. But those moments were part of the process. Fulbright never told me to have all the answers right away. Instead, it encouraged me to explore, to fail, to learn, and to grow at my own pace. And in the end, those doubts became my greatest teachers.\n\nThe friendships I’ve formed here have been another highlight. Fulbright is full of people who challenge you, who inspire you, and who help you become the best version of yourself. I’ll never forget the late-night conversations with friends and professors, where we debated everything from politics to art to the meaning of life itself. These moments, these connections, have shaped me in ways I’ll carry with me forever.\n\nAs I think about the future, I can’t help but feel excited. I have so many ideas, so many dreams, and I know that Fulbright has given me the tools and confidence to make them a reality. My time here has shown me that my journey is just beginning and that I don’t need to have it all figured out right now. What matters is that I keep moving forward with curiosity, with passion, and with the courage to follow my own path.\n\nA huge thank you to everyone who made this experience unforgettable. To my professors who pushed me to think beyond the obvious, to my friends who made every day an adventure, and to Fulbright for being the kind of place where reinvention is not just allowed but encouraged.</td>

We attended online classes by day, and in our free time, we’d sing random songs together. I especially remember "Ngày đầu tiên" by Đức Phúc—it had just come out around that time. We sang it non-stop until we were out of breath. Even now, whenever I hear it, all the memories of those quarantine days come rushing back (along with the scent of saline spray!).\n\nAfter we recovered, we returned to our dorm and were welcomed back with a full-on ribbon-cutting ceremony.

      <td>These All-Nighters Made Me\n\nMy college nights split into two chapters.\n\nThe first: nights out with my people—at The Waterfront, Docklands, anywhere we could just be. We were young, curious, a little wild. Those nights were filled with laughter, stories, tears, spontaneous drinking in Japanese town, clubbing till we crashed, wandering the residence halls just to feel something real. We shared everything—secrets, silence, sadness, joy. I met strangers who became friends, and friends who became memories. I made choices I celebrated and mistakes I had to sit with. But through it all, I learned. I grew. I’ll never forget those nights.\n\nThe second chapter: the study nights. The real, raw ones. The anxious cramming, the silent breakdowns, the Red Bulls and Monsters lined up on my desk like soldiers. The instant noodles at midnight, the endless loop of lo-fi beats. I used to hate exams—still kind of do—but somehow, I survived every one. I mastered the art of the all-nighter. Somewhere along the way, I stopped panicking and started trusting myself.\nTo everyone who was part of this chaos—my housemates, study buddies, 3AM Zoom crew, my cheat sheets and most importantly, my grades—thank you. You were part of it all.\n\nThese nights made me who I am. And no matter how much time passes, I’ll always remember them.</td>

But if there’s one thing I walk away with, it’s this: I became my own best friend. I learned to love numbers (yes, seriously), and I made myself proud.\n\nThis place gave me more than just an education. It gave me people—so many different individuals, each with their own quirks, stories, and strengths. I’m lucky to have kept high-quality connections with teammates, housemates, and faculty who shaped me. From them, I learned humility, collaboration, and how to handle conflict with grace. The Fulbright community supported me every step of the way—and one day, I promise to give that same support back to someone else who’s lost, confused, and curious like I once was.\n\nTo the people who held me up—thank you.\n119A, my first home.\nL307 and River Panorama, where the realest moments happened.\nMinh Phu, Loc Le, Khang Bi, and Tommy—my constants. You’ve seen all sides of me: the laughs, the breakdowns, the chaos, the growth. I’m grateful for your love and support, and I’m so excited to watch each of you shine after Fulbright.\n\nAcademically? Let’s just say, I used to run from math like it was chasing me. But then I took on Computer Science (shoutout to Tommy for surviving those courses with me—even if we’re in Econ now). Eventually, I found my fit in Economics. Algorithms didn’t work out, but regressions did.\n\nMinh Phu—thank you for being the calm in my academic storms. Your patience, your belief in me, and your endless encouragement helped unlock the best version of myself. That A-streak in advanced Econ? That’s ours. I’m in the final stages of my capstone now, crunching data and theories, and I’ve never felt more confident, sharper, or more ready to take on challenges.\n\nOne thing I’ll never regret? Developing the Fulbright Tennis Club. From day one, I poured my energy into it, and even on the tough days, you all reminded me why it mattered.\n\nChi Diem Quynh—thank you for always seeing my effort.\nMinh Phu—your compliments meant more than you know.\nKhang Bi &amp; Tommy—thank you for being the hands that held everything together.\nLy &amp; Quan—you’re the future of this club, and I can’t wait to see how you grow it.\nOther members—I am truly happy to see you guys get to be better every day\n\nAt the end of it all, I have no regrets.\n\nEverything I gave, everything I felt, everything I tried—it made these four years unforgettable.\n</td>

      <td>At Fulbright, I did not just gain knowledge or a new mindset - I gained the brothers and sisters who became one of my most important support systems. These were the people who saw me at my worst - broken down and crying my eyes out - but still poured strength and confidence into me with their support, love, understanding, and humor. \n\nIt would be a huge miss not to mention the very first online semester here. Even though we were going through so much, I still treasure those sleepless nights we called “study group”—supposedly to study, of course. But it usually turned into yapping, singing, and laughing till 5 am. Thanks to you guys, my first year of university - even while being stuck at home with Covid - was still super great and memorable (dedicated to mhiu, an đào, thùy dương, phúc thành). Please know that I will forever be grateful for all my heroes here!!!\n\nAnd the people don’t stop at friends - they also include the faculty and staff, who supported me both academically and personally. Thank you, cô Lan (Faculty of Psychology), cô Lan and thầy Ngọc (Faculty of Economics), chú Bình, anh Hậu, anh Tâm, các anh các chị cleaning staff who quietly helped and supported me throughout this journey. \n\nFinally, I would not be here, writing these words, without my family. \nThank you, Mom, for being the first person to believe in me more than I believed in myself.\nThank you, Dad, for always encouraging me to do anything I set my heart on. \nThank you, Hưng, for silently supporting me through every small act. \nCon cảm ơn ba mẹ rất nhiều, hy vọng con đã làm ba mẹ tự hào và hãnh diện.  \n\nI am still not quite ready to leave Fulbright. \nBut ready or not, I believe Fulbright gave us the strength\n… to speak up\n… to fall down\n… to get back up\n… and to try again\n\nI walked into Fulbright with dreams, but not yet the belief I could reach them. \nFour years later, I walk out not only believing — but knowing — that I can.\n\nProud to be a Fulbrighter. \nProud to belong to Cohort 25. \nProud to always embrace uncertainty.</td>

Fulbright might not have been where I thought I'd end up, but looking back, I wouldn't have it any other way.</td>

Thank you for the lessons you taught me about love, vulnerability, forgiveness, and strength. You made Fulbright home.\n\nWhatever paths we take from here, know that I’m rooting for you. Always.

I was 18, clueless and unprepared, and stumbling through uncertainty. Now I’m 22, still finding my way through uncertainty, but with a clearer sense of who I am and the courage to face what comes next. Fulbright has been more than just a university to me. It’s been a playground for curiosity, a battleground for self-doubt, and a sanctuary for self-discovery. I found mentors who saw potential in me when I couldn’t see it myself. I found friends who challenged me, cried and laughed with me, and cared for me. I learned that learning doesn’t just happen in classrooms—it happens in spontaneous dorm debates, in the hustle of the coffee shop, and in deadline night breakdowns with Monsters and snacks. There were times I wanted to give up. Times I thought I didn’t belong. But Fulbright taught me that growth can be uncomfortable sometimes; every failure, every confusing assignment, every group project that almost ended friendships: all of it shaped who I am today.\nTo my professors: thank you for pushing me, for your patience, and for seeing more than just a GPA.\nTo my friends: thank you for the unfiltered laughter and the deep 2 AM talks that reminded me I’m never alone.\nTo Fulbright: thank you for teaching me that kindness is a strength, and that the future is something we build, not wait for.</td>

There was a rare openness, a quiet curiosity, a willingness to truly listen, to challenge, and to grow together.\n\nOne moment that holds all of that for me is the staycation with seven friends before I left for exchange last Fall semester. Just a simple trip, but that night, it felt like the world slowed down. No deadlines, no expectations, just presence. It was one of the few times in my Fulbright years when I felt completely myself, surrounded by people who truly saw me.\n\nIn that space, we weren’t just students chasing Capstone deadlines or worrying about the future. We were dreamers, thinkers, and friends, building something bigger than ourselves. That’s what I’ll carry with me long after Fulbright.</td>

To the Class of 2025, to the faculty, to the staff - to those still here and those who’ve already left. Because Fulbright, to me, has never been just about a college or a degree. It’s been about people.\n\nTo my fellow Co25 friends, many of whom I’ve had the joy of sharing classes, meals, laughter, stress, and late-night rants with: thank you. I don’t think there’s a single person in this cohort I haven’t crossed paths with in some way. And every time, it felt like something added to the fabric of my journey. Maybe it was a short chat on campus, a group project that nearly broke us, a random deep conversation, or just a familiar face at a time I needed it most. You made this place feel like home, even on the hardest days. I carry so much love and respect for each of you. More than anything, I’m genuinely so excited to see all of you fly high and far. You are all so, so capable, and so talented in ways that continue to amaze me. Watching you grow, and growing alongside you, has been one of the greatest honors of my life. Truly. It’s been a privilege to call so many of you my friends.\n\nTo the faculty, whether you're still teaching here or have moved on, thank you for your patience, your passion, and your presence. Some of you changed the way I see the world, not just through lectures or feedback, but through the way you taught us to think critically, to think ethically, and to think empathetically. Even when I didn’t have the answers, you made it feel okay to ask better questions. I’ve felt seen, challenged, and encouraged in ways I didn’t expect when I first walked into those classrooms.\n\nTo the staff, past and present, I want you to know how much your work has meant to me and to all of us. The check-ins, the support emails, the behind-the-scenes work you never asked credit for, the way you remembered our names and asked how we were doing, even during the busiest times. It’s hard to put into words how comforting it is to feel genuinely cared for in a space that could’ve easily been just another institution. You gave it heart.\n\nThese past four years have not been easy for Fulbright. We’ve all felt the waves, the uncertainties, the growing pains. But I truly believe that each of you, in your own way, in your own capacity, has done your best to steer this ship through so many storms. And for that, you deserve more gratitude than we probably ever say out loud. Thank you for showing up, for holding the line, and for keeping the school afloat even when things were tough.\n\nEspecially to the Admissions team (and I say this with deep love and immense gratitude), thank you for letting me be a part of your world for the past four years. I want to be clear that I deeply cherish every department in this school, and I hope the rest of you will forgive me for singling one out. But working with Admissions was something truly special. I’ve learned so much, not just about outreach or selection, but about people, about kindness, about stories, and about the quiet, powerful impact of believing in someone before they even believe in themselves.\n\nThere’s no single memory that sums it all up. It’s the little things that linger: the way someone held the elevator door, the messages during Capstone madness, or the quiet comfort of walking into a room full of people who somehow, despite all our differences, understood what this journey meant. Fulbright gave me a thousand tiny memories that, stitched together, made something I’ll hold onto forever.\n\nSo if this is the last letter I get to write here, let it be a thank you. A quiet, sincere, full-hearted thank you. I’m leaving, but I’ll always carry this place, and all of you, with me.\n\nWith love,</td>

      <td>During my four years at Fulbright, I’ve had both good and bad memories—but I cherish them all, as they’ve shaped who I am today. Among them, the military training course (MTC) stands out as the most beautiful and emotionally truthful experience I’ve had.\n\nThere are two main reasons for this. First, MTC reminded me of my high school days. Unlike university life, where everyone is caught up in their own hustle, MTC placed us all in the same routine, same conditions, and same goal—making it out alive. Like high school, we studied, ate, and slept together. In that uniform setting, the only personal things we had were our emotions and relationships. With nothing else to distract us, we had all the time in the world to care for one another.\n\nSecond, the intensity of the training pushed us to find joy in the simplest, most organic ways. On the first day, I expected to keep to myself and get through it quietly. But the harsh summer heat and physical challenges brought us closer. We shared fans, food, jokes, drinks—and even moments of lying on the floor half-naked just to cool down. We supported each other through every chore and challenge, without conflict, because we knew we were all in the same boat.\n\nIt felt like rediscovering childhood with people my age—playing, singing, and bonding like kids again. It was rare, raw, and something I’ll carry with me for a long time.</td>
      <td>My Fulbright journey began in August 2021 with great excitement as I moved into the dorms, imagining something like a Scout camp. But living away from home for the first time brought unexpected loneliness, despite staying in touch with family. Learning to manage daily life independently was a major shift. Social connections didn’t come easily at first, and my academics took time to find their rhythm. However, courses like Prof. Kinho Chan’s and Prof. Jonathan London’s courses had a transformative impact.\n\nThings gradually shifted. Moving to Docklands in my second year brought closer friendships and a more stable environment. I explored Math, Engineering, and eventually found a home in Arts and Media Studies. I’m grateful for foundational film training with Professors Linda, Viet Linh, Phan Dang Di, and Ivan Small. My academic experience deepened in the later years, especially in 300-level courses. Prof. Pamela Corey’s art landscape class and Prof. Tram Luong’s ethnography course were eye-opening. Prof. Tobias’s curiosity-driven approach connected diverse fields in meaningful ways. Even personal hardship, became a space for reflection, thanks to Prof. Ian Kalman.\n\nIn my final year, I discovered Vietnam Studies with guidance from Prof. Nam and Prof. Hoang. Fulbright has shaped me into a more resilient, reflective, and curious person.\n\nI am deeply grateful to the professors and friends who inspired and supported me. Your impact will stay with me for life. Thank you.</td>

And that’s what makes it unforgettable.</td>

      <td>“The secret of getting ahead is getting started.” – Mark Twain\n\nThis quote reminds me that every grand journey begins with the courage to take that first small step. For me, this adage has been a silent yet persistent motivator on days when doubt loomed large.</td>
      <td>What I cherish most about my time here is the permission I found to explore - the freedom to try things I had never even considered possible before. \n\nI had always been curious about the arts and the sciences, and Fulbright offered a rich tapestry of courses and extracurricular activities that allowed me to dabble in drawing, singing, dancing, filmmaking, engineering, and research. Each new class or workshop was a doorway to experiment, to fail, and ultimately to learn something profound about myself.\n\nI also cherish the moments of serendipity - those unplanned adventures that turned into some of my most treasured memories. Whether it was an impromptu jam session in the dorm common room, a spontaneous road trip to explore hidden parts of Saigon, or the quiet evenings spent under the stars discussing our dreams and fears, these experiences reminded me that life is full of unexpected wonders.\n\nUltimately, my time at Fulbright taught me that education is an expansive journey. I learned that intellectual growth is intertwined with personal development and that every activity contributes to a richer, more complex sense of self. The chance to embrace so many different facets of learning has forever altered my outlook on life. Fulbright was not merely a place of study; it was a nurturing ground for curiosity, courage, and creativity. It showed me that the real value of education lies in the diverse experiences that challenge you to become better, kinder, and more resilient.</td>
      <td>I come from a mountainous region where access to higher education was a distant dream. This journey at Fulbright, which began in a small, remote village, has transformed me in ways I once only dared to imagine. My time at Fulbright is a tapestry woven with hardship, discovery, and triumph.\n\nIn my hometown, resources were scarce, and expectations were modest. Education was valued, but opportunities were limited. The decision to leave my mountainous home and venture to Saigon was both exhilarating and terrifying. Saigon, with its bustling energy and modern allure, was a stark contrast to my quiet, rugged upbringing. I arrived with a mix of excitement and apprehension, unsure if I would fit in or if I was even capable of achieving what many deemed impossible.\n\nStudying at Fulbright was a turning point - a validation that my potential was recognized beyond the boundaries of my humble beginnings. It opened doors not just to academic excellence, but also to a world of experiences that I had never imagined I would encounter. At Fulbright, I was not just a student; I was a creator, a performer, a researcher, and ultimately, a person in the making.\n\nPerhaps the most transformative aspect of my time at Fulbright was the community I found here. My classmates and professors came from diverse backgrounds, each bringing their own unique perspectives to the table. Our differences were not barriers—they were bridges that connected us. In group projects, late-night study sessions, and spontaneous discussions about life and dreams, I discovered the power of collaboration and empathy. I made friends who challenged me to grow, who celebrated my successes, and who held my hand during moments of doubt. The support and understanding I received were beyond what I could have ever hoped for.\n\nI learned to trust my instincts, to stand firm in my decisions, and to embrace the uncertainty of the future with open arms. Every setback was a lesson, every failure a testament to my resilience, and every success a glimpse of the person I was becoming.\n\nThe most profound impact of my Fulbright experience is how it reshaped my understanding of purpose. Coming from a normal background, I had always dreamed of a future where I could transcend the limitations imposed by my circumstances. Fulbright not only provided me with the education to pursue that dream—it instilled in me the confidence to believe that I could make a meaningful impact in the world. With my newfound skills and experiences, I was able to secure a job aligned with my passion for music—an area I had always loved but never imagined could be a viable career. This opportunity, born out of chance and nurtured by hard work, has given me the confidence to face every decision with a sense of purpose and determination.</td>

      <td>At Fulbright, I didn’t just step out of my comfort zone — I leapt. And in that leap, I found resilience, purpose, and the courage to grow.</td>
      <td>I still vividly remember my first day at Fulbright — which was also the very first day of my first semester. I had two classes that day and was excited to arrive on time, eager to meet my professors and classmates.\nStrangely enough, it was also my first time stepping foot on the Crescent campus. I didn’t know how to enter the buildings or where the classrooms were. I was too embarrassed to ask anyone, thinking to myself, “How can I be a student here and not even know where my classes are?”\nI still smile at those early moments — the awkwardness, the embarrassment of my first wrong answer, and even the first time I called a professor by their first name without realizing it. But those moments quickly passed. From the very beginning, I was surrounded by kind friends, peer mentors, and supportive instructors.\nI’m deeply grateful to have studied at Fulbright and to have grown in such a heartwarming environment that allowed me to make mistakes, learn from them, and build the courage to step outside of my comfort zone.\nPresident Scott once shared that one of the guiding principles of our university is to create a safe and supportive space where students are encouraged to speak up, take initiative, and continuously grow. Thank you for saying it — and thank you, Fulbright, for truly living it.\nBecause over these past four years, I’ve felt it deeply: I’ve been embraced, nurtured, and empowered to become the best version of myself.</td>
      <td>As you can see on this page, my memories with Fulbright are also deeply tied to my time with the Fulbright Ultimate Club (FUC), our ultimate frisbee team. Over the past four years, I’ve laughed, cried, pushed through pain and bitterness, and received so much love from our coaches and teammates.\nMy journey with FUC has been far more than just athletic training — it’s been a journey of stepping out of my comfort zone, building resilience, and learning how to love, care for, encourage, and inspire others like a true family.\nThrough FUC and frisbee, I’ve traveled across Vietnam and even to other countries for tournaments. We’ve shared victories, earned medals, and made memories that I’ll carry for life.\nAnd deep down, I know that all the love and memories we’ve shared could only have happened here — at Fulbright.\nFulbright is a place where inclusiveness, diversity, and equality are truly cherished. It’s where students are lifted up, where we’re given a safe and empowering environment to pursue our dreams — even the wildest ones.</td>

It's not just about the academics, but it's also about the people I have had the chance to encounter and know personally. I want to take this space to thank founding Professor Andrew Bellisari who altered my brain chemistry in his Global Humanities class and then his nefarious course Pirates, Prisoners, and Prostitutes: An Outcast History of French Indochina, founding Professor Kevin Hart whom I was in his Foundations of Literary Studies class during his last semester at Fulbright, Professor Yến Vũ who taught me elegance in nourishing my writing and her overwhelming patience with me, Professor Richard Streitmatter-Trần for forever inspiring me with his art practices and the philosophy in making life choices (and fashion choices), Professor Izzy Liendo for whom I was working in her classroom as a teaching assistant and also a student in her crazy courses - for her sweet-toothed treats and never leaving me behind on those difficult burn-out days, Professor Linda Zhang who entrusted me with my first classroom assistant job and made me feel so loved working for, and Professor Jasmine An for giving me the guts and dictionary to craft my thoughts into poetry.</td>
